Ten distinct peptides were obtained by cyanogen bromide digestion. The peptide alpha 1 (III)-CB5 was further purified by carboxymethylcellulose chromatography, and its amino acid sequence was determined. Automatic Edman degradation of intact alpha 1 (III)-CB5, tryptic and thermolytic peptides, and hydroxylamine-derived fragments was used to establish the total sequence. The mammalian collagenase site contained in the alpha 1 (III)-CB5 sequence was ascertained by digestion of native type III collagen with purified rheumatoid synovial collagenase. Collagenase cleavage occurred at a single Gly--Ile bond, one triplet before the corresponding specific cleavage site of type I collagen. The present work brings the known sequence of human liver type III collagen to include alpha 1 (III)-CB3-7-6-1-8-10-2-4-5. These correspond to the homologous region of alpha 1 (I)-CB0-1-2-4-5-8-3-7 residues 11--804.",

These processes are modulated by extracellular matrix components, such as heparan sulfate (HS) polysaccharides.

We report here mutations in HS 6-O-sulfotransferase 1 (HS6ST1) in families with idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH). IHH manifests as incomplete or absent puberty and infertility as a result of defects in gonadotropin-releasing hormone neuron development or function. IHH-associated HS6ST1 mutations display reduced activity in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that HS6ST1 and the complex modifications of extracellular sugars are critical for normal development in humans. Genetic experiments in Caenorhabditis elegans reveal that HS cell-specifically regulates neural branching in vivo in concert with other IHH-associated genes, including kal-1, the FGF receptor, and FGF. These findings are consistent with a model in which KAL1 can act as a modulatory coligand with FGF to activate the FGF receptor in an HS-dependent manner.",

MAB21L1, mapped to 13q13, contains a highly polymorphic 5' untranslated CAG repeat that normally ranges from six to 31 triplets in length. A pedigree has been previously reported in which the repeat length is expanded to 45-50 triplets and is transmitted unstably between generations; the expansion did not correlate to a clinical phenotype but did exhibit somatic mosaicism. We now report a second pedigree with an expanded and unstably transmitted MAB21L1 CAG repeat of similar length. The expansion is not clearly associated with a clinical phenotype, though the complexity of the pedigree renders any conclusion concerning phenotype-genotype relationships speculative. The expansion did not result in decreased expression of MAB21L1 protein. The length, C-G rich composition, somatic mosaicism, and unstable transmission of the expanded CAG repeat in MAB21L1 resemble the premutations observed in other genes, such as FMR1 and MDPK, in which longer expanded repeats are associated with a clinical phenotype. This raises the possibility that longer expansions in the MAB21L1 repeat may also be associated with a clinical phenotype.",

We investigated the interaction of both naturally occurring long and short CaBP1 isoforms with InsP(3)Rs, and their functional effects on InsP(3)R-evoked Ca(2+) signals. Using several experimental paradigms, including transient expression in COS cells, acute injection of recombinant protein into Xenopus oocytes and (45)Ca(2+) flux from permeabilised COS cells, we demonstrated that CaBPs decrease the sensitivity of InsP(3)-induced Ca(2+) release (IICR). In addition, we found a Ca(2+)-independent interaction between CaBP1 and the NH(2)-terminal 159 amino acids of the type 1 InsP(3)R. This interaction resulted in decreased InsP(3) binding to the receptor reminiscent of that observed for CaM. Unlike CaM, however, CaBPs do not inhibit ryanodine receptors, have a higher affinity for InsP(3)Rs and more potently inhibited IICR. We also show that phosphorylation of CaBP1 at a casein kinase 2 consensus site regulates its inhibition of IICR. Our data suggest that CaBPs are endogenous regulators of InsP(3)Rs tuning the sensitivity of cells to InsP(3).",

        "abstracttext": "Activated estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) modulates transcription triggered by the transcription factor activator protein-1 (AP-1), which consists of Jun-Jun homodimers and Jun-Fos heterodimers. Previous studies have demonstrated that the interference occurs without binding of ERalpha to DNA but probably results from protein.protein interactions. However, involvement of a direct interaction between ERalpha and AP-1 is still debated. Using glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays, we demonstrated that ERalpha bound directly to c-Jun and JunB but not to FOS family members, in a ligand-independent manner. The interaction could occur when c-Jun was bound onto DNA, as shown in a protein-protein-DNA assay. It implicated the C-terminal part of c-Jun and amino acids 259-302 present in the ERalpha hinge domain. ERalpha but not an ERalpha mutant deleted of amino acids 250-303 (ER241G), also associated with c-Jun in intact cells, in the presence of estradiol, as shown by two-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation assays. We also show that ERalpha, c-Jun, and the p160 coactivator GRIP1 can form a multiprotein complex in vitro and in intact cells and that the ERalpha.c-Jun interaction could be crucial for the stability of this complex. VP16-ERalpha and c-Jun, which both interact with GRIP1, had synergistic effect on GAL4-GRIP1-induced transcription in the presence of estradiol, and this synergistic effect was not observed with the ERalpha mutant VP16-ER241G or when c-Fos, which bound GRIP1 but not ERalpha, was used instead of c-Jun. Finally, ER241G was inefficient for regulation of AP-1 activity, and an ERalpha truncation mutant encompassing the hinge domain had a dominant negative effect on ERalpha action. These results altogether demonstrate that ERalpha can bind to c-Jun in vitro and in intact cells and that this interaction, by stabilizing a multiprotein complex containing p160 coactivator, is likely to be involved in estradiol regulation of AP-1 responses.",

We investigated the role of system y+L in NO synthesis in HUVECs. Transport of 1.5 microM L-arginine was inhibited (P < 0.05) by L-lysine (K(i), 1.4 micro M), L-leucine (K(i), 1.8 micro M) and L-phenylalanine (K(i), 4.1 microM), but was unaltered (P > 0.05) by L-alanine or L-cysteine. The system y+/CATs inhibitor, N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), did not alter 1.5 microM L-arginine transport, but inhibited (92 +/- 3 %) 100 microM L-arginine transport. L-arginine transport in the presence of NEM was saturable (V(max), 0.37 +/- 0.02 pmol (microg protein)(-1) min(-1); K(m), 1.5 +/- 0.3 microM) and competitively inhibited by L-leucine in the presence of Na+ (V(max), 0.49 +/- 0.06 pmol (microg protein)(-1) min(-1); K(m), 6.5 +/- 0.9 microM). HUVECs express SLC3A2/4F2hc, SLC7A7/4F2-lc2 and SLC7A6/4F2-lc3 genes encoding for the high-affinity transport system y+L. N(G)-Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester and L-leucine, but not NEM, inhibited NO synthesis in medium containing 1.5 microM L-arginine. Cells exposed to 25 mM D-glucose (24 h) exhibited reduced system y+L activity (V(max), 0.15 +/- 0.008 pmol (microg protein)(-1) min(-1); K(m), 1.4 +/- 0.3 microM) and NO synthesis. However, 25 mM D-glucose increased NO synthesis and L-arginine transport via system y+.

Here we developed a robust strategy that integrates molecular weight cutoff, neutral loss-dependent MS(3), database-independent candidate spectrum filtering, and optimization to effectively identify CF glycoproteins. The rationale for spectrum treatment was innovatively based on computation of the mass distribution in spectra of CF glycopeptides. The efficacy of this strategy was demonstrated by implementation for plasma from healthy subjects and subjects with hepatocellular carcinoma. Over 100 CF glycoproteins and CF sites were identified, and over 10,000 mass spectra of CF glycopeptide were found.

Chem. 266, 10880-10887) identified an estrogen receptor (ER) mutant which had a similar binding affinity for estradiol as wild-type ER but displayed a dose-response shift for estradiol in transactivation studies. In this study, we have utilized hormone binding, DNA binding, and gene transfer experiments to further characterize this mutant, which contains an alanine substitution for a cysteine at amino acid 447 in the hormone binding domain of the receptor. Hormone binding studies indicate that the C447A receptor is a temperature-sensitive mutant, whose instability is only apparent at elevated temperatures, and that ligand can stabilize the mutant receptor. Western blot analysis reveals that the temperature-sensitive loss of hormone binding is not attributable to a degradation of receptor protein, but rather is an inactivation of the receptor's hormone binding ability. In addition to the loss in the hormone binding capacity of the C447A mutant, this mutant shows a temperature-sensitive loss in the DNA binding ability of the receptor. Transactivation profiles of the mutant and wild-type receptors demonstrate that incubation of transfected cells with increasing concentrations of estradiol at more ambient temperatures shifts the mutant receptor's dose-response curves to the left, converging on the wild-type curve. Hence, these transactivation studies reveal that the dose-response shift observed for this mutant in cells reflects the measured instability of the hormone binding and DNA interaction of the C447A mutant that can be demonstrated in vitro. In addition, this temperature-sensitive ER mutant is of interest in that its DNA binding is now ligand-dependent with the result that transcriptional activation now parallels receptor occupancy by ligand, which is similar to other steroid hormone receptors.",

Strikingly, human WIPI genes were found aberrantly expressed in a variety of matched tumor tissues including kidney, pancreatic and skin cancer. We found that endogenous hWIPI-1 protein colocalizes in part with the autophagosomal marker LC3 at punctate cytoplasmic structures in human melanoma cells. In addition, hWIPI-1 accumulated in large vesicular and cup-shaped structures in the cytoplasm when autophagy was induced by amino-acid deprivation.

Superimposition of this structure with the h3alpha-HSD3-NADP(H)-testosterone/acetate ternary complex structure reveals that one of the mobile loops forming the binding cavity operates a slight contraction movement against the citrate molecule while the side chains of many residues undergo numerous conformational changes, probably to create an optimal binding site for the citrate. These structural changes, which altogether cause a reduction of the substrate-binding cavity volume (from 776 A(3) in the presence of testosterone/acetate to 704 A(3) in the acetate/citrate complex), are reminiscent of the \"induced-fit\" mechanism previously proposed for the aldose reductase, another member of the AKR superfamily. We also found that the replacement of residues Arg(301) and Arg(304), localized near the steroid-binding cavity, significantly affects the 3alpha-HSD activity of this enzyme toward 5alpha-DHT and completely abolishes its 17beta-HSD activity on 4-dione. All these results have thus been used to reevaluate the binding mode of this enzyme for androgens.",

Both coactivators and corepressors have been shown to use similar but functionally distinct NR interacting determinants containing the core motifs LxxLL and PhixxPhiPhi, respectively. These interactions occur through a hydrophobic cleft located on the surface of the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of the NR and are regulated by ligand-dependent activation function 2 (AF-2). In an effort to identify novel coregulators that function independently of AF-2, we used the LBD of the orphan receptor RVR (which lacks AF-2) as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen. This strategy led to the cloning of a nuclear protein referred to as CIA (coactivator independent of AF-2 function) that possesses both repressor and activator functions. Strikingly, we observed that CIA not only interacts with RVR and Rev-ErbAalpha in a ligand-independent manner but can also form complexes with estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) and ERbeta in vitro and enhances ERalpha transcriptional activity in the presence of estradiol (E(2)). CIA-ERalpha interactions were found to be independent of AF-2 and enhanced by the antiestrogens EM-652 and ICI 182,780 but not by 4-hydroxytamoxifen and raloxifene. We further demonstrate that CIA-ERalpha interactions require the presence within CIA of a novel bifunctional NR recognition determinant containing overlapping LxxLL and PhixxPhiPhi motifs. The identification and functional characterization of CIA suggest that hormone binding can create a functional coactivator interaction interface in the absence of AF-2.",

PMEPA1 was identified as a gene highly up-regulated by TGF-beta treatment of VACO 330. Northern blot analysis confirmed TGF-beta induction of PMEPA1 in VACO 330, as well as a panel of three other TGF-beta-sensitive colon cell lines. PMEPA1 induction could be detected as early as 2 h after TGF-beta treatment and was not inhibited by pretreatment of cells with cycloheximide, suggesting that PMEPA1 is a direct target of TGF-beta signaling. Wild-type PMEPA1 and an alternative splice variant lacking the putative transmembrane domain were encoded by the PMEPA1 locus and were shown by epitope tagging to encode proteins with differing subcellular localization. Both variants were found to be expressed in normal colonic epithelium, and both were shown to be induced by TGF-beta. Consistent with TGF-beta playing a role in terminal differentiation of colonocytes, in situ hybridization of normal colonic epithelium localized PMEPA1 expression to nonproliferating, terminally differentiated epithelium located at the top of colonic crypts. Intriguingly, in situ hybridization and Northern blot analysis showed that the expression of PMEPA1 was well maintained both in colon cancer primary tumors and in colon cancer liver metastases. PMEPA1 is thus a novel TGF-beta-induced marker of a differentiated crypt cell population. Moreover, as PMEPA1 expression is maintained, presumptively in a TGF-beta-independent manner after malignant transformation and metastasis, it demonstrates that even late colon cancers retain a strong capacity to execute many steps of the normal colonic differentiation program.",

We have investigated the role of three ERalpha gene polymorphisms [intron 1 PVU:II and XBA:I RFLPs and TA dinucleotide repeat polymorphism 5' upstream of exon 1] in 610 postmenopausal women. There was a strong linkage disequilibrium between intron 1 polymorphic sites and also between these sites and the microsatellite (TA)(n) dinucleotide polymorphism, with a high degree of coincidence of the short TA alleles and the presence of PVU:II and XBA:I restriction sites. No significant relationship between intron 1 RFLPs and BMD was observed. A statistically significant correlation between (TA)(n) repeat allelic variants and lumbar BMD was observed (P = 0.04, ANCOVA), with subjects with a low number of repeats (TA < 15) showing the lowest BMD values. We observed a statistically significant difference in the mean +/- SD number of TA repeats between analyzed women with a vertebral fracture (n = 73) and the non-fracture group, equivalent to 2.9 (95% CI 1.56-5.72) increased fracture risk in women with a low number of repeats (TA < 15). We conclude that in this large population sample the (TA)(n) dinucleotide repeat polymorphism at the 5' end of the ERalpha gene accounts for part of the heritable component of BMD and might prove useful in the prediction of vertebral fracture risk in postmenopausal osteoporosis.",

Here we demonstrate that Rbp2 not only binds to nuclear receptors (NRs) but also enhances the transcription mediated by them. Rbp2 interacts with the DNA-binding domains of NRs and potentiates NR-mediated transcription in an AF-2-dependent manner. Both the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of Rbp2 are critical for the transactivation activity of Rbp2 on NRs. The C terminus is the NR-interacting region. In addition, RB functions in maximizing the effect of Rbp2 on the transcription by NRs. These results suggest that Rbp2 is a coregulator of NRs and define a potential role for Rbp2 in NR-mediated transcription.",

Indeed, the other AKR enzymes that significantly reduce keto groups situated at position C17 of the steroid nucleus, the human type 3 3alpha-HSD (h3alpha-HSD3), the human and mouse type 5 17beta-HSD, and the rabbit 20alpha-HSD, produce only 17beta-hydroxy derivatives, although they possess more than 70% amino acid identity with m17alpha-HSD. Structural comparisons of these highly homologous enzymes thus offer an excellent opportunity of identifying the molecular determinants responsible for their 17alpha/17beta-stereospecificity. Here, we report the crystal structure of the m17alpha-HSD enzyme in its apo-form (1.9 A resolution) as well as those of two different forms of this enzyme in binary complex with NADP(H) (2.9 A and 1.35 A resolution). Interestingly, one of these binary complex structures could represent a conformational intermediate between the apoenzyme and the active binary complex. These structures provide a complete picture of the NADP(H)-enzyme interactions involving the flexible loop B, which can adopt two different conformations upon cofactor binding. Structural comparison with binary complexes of other AKR1C enzymes has also revealed particularities of the interaction between m17alpha-HSD and NADP(H), which explain why it has been possible to crystallize this enzyme in its apo form. Close inspection of the m17alpha-HSD steroid-binding cavity formed upon cofactor binding leads us to hypothesize that the residue at position 24 is of paramount importance for the stereospecificity of the reduction reaction. Mutagenic studies have showed that the m17alpha-HSD(A24Y) mutant exhibited a completely reversed stereospecificity, producing testosterone only from Delta4, whereas the h3alpha-HSD3(Y24A) mutant acquires the capacity to metabolize Delta4 into epi-T.",

Here we report that subpopulations of murine, bovine, and human estrogen receptors are modified by O-GlcNAc. O-GlcNAc moieties were detected on insect cell-expressed, mouse ER (mER) by probing with bovine milk galactosyltransferase, followed by structural analysis. Wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose affinity chromatography also readily detected terminal GlcNAc residues on subpopulations of ER purified from calf uterus, from human breast cancer cells (MCF-7), or from mER produced by in vitro translation. These data suggest that greater than 10% of these populations of estrogen receptors bear O-GlcNAc. Site mapping of insect cell expressed mER localized one major site of O-GlcNAc addition to Thr-575, within a PEST region of the carboxyl-terminal F domain. Based upon their relative resistance to both hexosaminidase and to in vitro galactosylation, O-GlcNAc moieties appear to be largely buried on native mER.

Analyses of protein synthesis, cytoplasmic subcompartmental distribution and movement of FGFR1-EGFP and FGFR1 mutants showed that FGFR1 exists as three separate populations (a) a newly synthesized, highly mobile, nonglycosylated, cytosolic receptor that is depleted by brefeldin A and resides outside the ER-Golgi lumen, (b) a slowly diffusing membrane receptor population, and (c) an immobile membrane pool increased by brefeldin A. RSK1 increases the highly mobile cytosolic FGFR1 population and its overall diffusion rate leading to increased FGFR1 nuclear accumulation, which coaccumulates with RSK1. A model is proposed in which newly synthesized FGFR1 can enter the (a) \"nuclear pathway,\" where the nonglycosylated receptor is extruded from the pre-Golgi producing highly mobile cytosolic receptor molecules that rapidly accumulate in the nucleus or (b) \"membrane pathway,\" in which FGFR1 is processed through the Golgi, where its movement is spatially restricted to trans-Golgi membranes with limited lateral mobility.

We found de novo mutation in these two patients (Cys178Ser and Arg622Gly, respectively), and one inherited Arg622Gln mutation with intrafamilial variable phenotype. These genotype-phenotype correlations indicate that paediatric phenotypic expression of FGFR1 loss of function mutations is highly variable, the severity of the oro-facial malformations at birth does not predict gonadotropic function at the puberty and that de novo mutations of FGFR1 are relatively frequent.",

        "abstracttext": "We have identified a new human cDNA (y+L amino acid transporter-1 (y+LAT-1)) that induces system y+L transport activity with 4F2hc (the surface antigen 4F2 heavy chain) in oocytes. Human y+LAT-1 is a new member of a family of polytopic transmembrane proteins that are homologous to the yeast high affinity methionine permease MUP1. Other members of this family, the Xenopus laevis IU12 and the human KIAA0245 cDNAs, also co-express amino acid transport activity with 4F2hc in oocytes, with characteristics that are compatible with those of systems L and y+L, respectively. y+LAT-1 protein forms a approximately 135-kDa, disulfide bond-dependent heterodimer with 4F2hc in oocytes, which upon reduction results in two protein bands of approximately 85 kDa (i.e. 4F2hc) and approximately 40 kDa (y+LAT-1). Mutation of the human 4F2hc residue cysteine 109 (Cys-109) to serine abolishes the formation of this heterodimer and drastically reduces the co-expressed transport activity. These data suggest that y+LAT-1 and other members of this family are different 4F2 light chain subunits, which associated with 4F2hc, constitute different amino acid transporters. Human y+LAT-1 mRNA is expressed in kidney > peripheral blood leukocytes > lung > placenta = spleen > small intestine. The human y+LAT-1 gene localizes at chromosome 14q11.2 (17cR approximately 374 kb from D14S1350), within the lysinuric protein intolerance (LPI) locus (Lauteala, T., Sistonen, P. , Savontaus, M. L., Mykkanen, J., Simell, J., Lukkarinen, M., Simmell, O., and Aula, P. (1997) Am. J. Hum. Genet. 60, 1479-1486). LPI is an inherited autosomal disease characterized by a defective dibasic amino acid transport in kidney, intestine, and other tissues. The pattern of expression of human y+LAT-1, its co-expressed transport activity with 4F2hc, and its chromosomal location within the LPI locus, suggest y+LAT-1 as a candidate gene for LPI.",

An association between recombinant proteins; ERalpha and MS-KIF18A was demonstrated in vitro in a pull down assay. Such interactions were proven also for endogenous proteins in MBA-15 cells were detected prominently in the cytoplasm and are up-regulated by estrogen. Additionally, an association between these proteins and the transcription factor NF-kappaB was identified. MS-KIF18A mRNA expression was measured in vivo in relation to age and estrogen level in mice and rats models. A decrease in MS-KIF18A mRNA level was measured in old and in OVX-estrogen depleted rats as compared to young animals. The low MS-KIF18A mRNA expression in OVX rats was restored by estrogen treatment. We studied the regulation of MS-KIF18A transcription by estrogen using the luciferase reporter gene and chromatin immuno-precipitation (ChIP) assays. The luciferase reporter gene assay demonstrated an increase in MS-KIF18A promoter activity in response to 10(-8) M estrogen and 10(-7)M ICI-182,780. Complimentary, the ChIP assay quantified the binding of ERalpha and pcJun to the MS-KIF18A promoter that was enhanced in cells treated by estrogen and ICI-182,780. In addition, cells treated by estrogen expressed higher levels of MS-KIF18A mRNA and protein and the protein turnover in MBA-15 cells was accelerated. Presented data demonstrated that ERalpha is a defined cargo of MS-KIF18A and added novel insight on the role of estrogen in regulation of MS-KIF18A expression both in vivo and in vitro.",

The spatial and temporal expression patterns of FGFs and FGFRs and the ability of specific ligand-receptor pairs to actively signal are important factors regulating FGF activity in a variety of biological processes. FGF signaling activity is regulated by the binding specificity of ligands and receptors and is modulated by extrinsic cofactors such as heparan sulfate proteoglycans. In previous studies, we have engineered BaF3 cell lines to express the seven principal FGFRs and used these cell lines to determine the receptor binding specificity of FGFs 1-9 by using relative mitogenic activity as the readout. Here we have extended these semiquantitative studies to assess the receptor binding specificity of the remaining FGFs 10-23.

A key step for the PINCH function is its localization to FAs, which depends critically on the tight binding of PINCH to integrin-linked kinase (ILK). Here we report the solution NMR structure of the core ILK.PINCH complex (28 kDa, K(D) approximately 68 nm) involving the N-terminal ankyrin repeat domain (ARD) of ILK and the first LIM domain (LIM1) of PINCH. We show that the ILK ARD exhibits five sequentially stacked ankyrin repeat units, which provide a large concave surface to grip the two contiguous zinc fingers of the PINCH LIM1. The highly electrostatic interface is evolutionally conserved but differs drastically from those of known ARD and LIM bound to other types of protein domains. Consistently mutation of a hot spot in LIM1, which is not conserved in other LIM domains, disrupted the PINCH binding to ILK and abolished the PINCH targeting to FAs. These data provide atomic insight into a novel modular recognition and demonstrate how PINCH is specifically recruited by ILK to mediate the FA assembly and cell-extracellular matrix communication.",

To approach an understanding of OTase/IRAP gene regulation the organization of the human gene was determined. Accordingly, three overlapping genomic clones were isolated and characterized. The human OTase/IRAP gene (OTASE) was found to span approximately 75 kb containing 18 exons and 17 introns. The gluzincin aminopeptidase motif: GAMEN-(31 amino acids)-HELAH-(18 amino acids)-E associated with Zn2+-binding, substrate binding and catalysis is encoded by exons 6 and 7. A major and a minor transcriptional initiation site in OTASE were identified by primer extension 514 bp and 551 bp, respectively, upstream of the translation start codon. Chloroamphenicol acetyltransferase-reporter assays revealed a functional CpG-rich promoter/enhancer region located between nucleotide -621 and the major transcriptional initiation site. Human OTASE was assigned to chromosome 5 by hybridization to genomic DNA from characterized somatic cell hybrids.

REN-9, -10, -19, and -26 have a known association with human cancer. REN-9 (LUCA-15) and REN-10 (gene 21) map to the small cell lung cancer tumor suppressor gene locus on chromosome 3p21.3. REN-19 is equivalent to LKB1/STK11, a gene that is defective in Peutz-Jeghers syndrome and cancer. REN-26 is encoded by the bcr gene involved in the [t(9:22)] bcr/abl translocation. Genes encoding 3 of the antigens in the series showed differential mRNA expression; REN-3 displays a pattern of tissue-specific isoforms, and REN-21 and REN-43 are expressed at a high level in testis in comparison to 15 other normal tissues. The other 62 antigens were broadly expressed in normal tissues. With regard to immunogenicity, 20 of the 65 antigens reacted only with autologous sera. Thirty-three antigens reacted with sera from normal donors, indicating that their immunogenicity is not restricted to cancer. The remaining 12 antigens reacted with sera from 5-25% of the cancer patients but not with sera from normal donors. Seventy percent of the renal cancer patients had antibodies directed against one or more of these 12 antigens.

        "abstracttext": "Viral entry into host cells depends upon specific interactions between virus attachment proteins and cell surface receptors that enable virus binding and internalization of virus and/or the virus-receptor complex. We have recently reported that the ubiquitous cell surface molecule, decay-accelerating factor (DAF), is a major cell attachment receptor for Coxsackieviruses B1, B3, and B5. However, DAF permits only virus binding and not virus internalization, invoking the presence of secondary or accessory receptors. Among the known receptors for enteroviruses are members of the cell adhesion molecule family known as integrins. In the present study, we found that expression of the epithelial-restricted integrin, alpha v beta 6, on colonic epithelial cells significantly enhanced Coxsackievirus B1-mediated cell lysis. Importantly, the viral-mediated cell killing required the presence of the 11-amino-acid C-terminal cytoplasmic extension unique to the beta 6 subunit, providing the first evidence of regulation of viral infectivity by integrin cytoplasmic domains. These results indicate that alpha v beta 6 expression on intestinal epithelial cells critically affects Coxsackievirus B1 infectivity. This may be essential in the conversion of asymptomatic enterovirus infection into clinically apparent disease.",

        "abstracttext": "Experiments were carried out to test the hypothesis that a 19-year-old proband with a mild variant of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV had a mutation in the gene for type III procollagen. cDNA and genomic DNA were analyzed by using the polymerase chain reaction and cloning of the products into M13 filamentous phage. A mutation was found that converted the codon for glycine 883 of the triple-helical domain in one allele for type III procollagen to a codon for aspartate. The polymerase chain reaction introduced a few artifactual single base substitutions. Also, it was difficult to distinguish copies from the two alleles in many of the M13 clones. Therefore, several different strategies and analyses of about 50,000 nucleotide sequences in a series of clones were used to demonstrate that the mutation in the codon for glycine 883 was the only mutation in coding sequences for the triple-helical domain of type III procollagen that could have contributed to the phenotype. The same mutation in the codon for glycine 883 in one allele for type III procollagen was found in the proband's 52-year-old father who also had a mild variant of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV. The type III procollagen synthesized by the proband's fibroblasts was analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Less type III procollagen was secreted by the proband's fibroblasts than by control fibroblasts. Also, the thermal stability of the type III procollagen synthesized by the proband's fibroblasts was lower than the thermal stability of normal type III procollagen as assayed by brief protease digestion. The results, therefore, demonstrated that the single base mutation that converted the codon of glycine 883 to a codon for aspartate destabilized the entire triple helix of type III procollagen and probably accounted for the mild phenotype of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV seen in the proband and her father.",

        "abstracttext": "Collagens are members of one of the most important families of structural proteins in higher organisms. There are 28 types of collagens encoded by 43 genes in humans that fall into several different functional protein classes. Mutations in the major fibrillar collagen genes lead to osteogenesis imperfecta (COL1A1 and COL1A2 encoding the chains of Type I collagen), chondrodysplasias (COL2A1 encoding the chains of Type II collagen), and vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (COL3A1 encoding the chains of Type III collagen). Over the past 2 decades, mutations in these collagen genes have been catalogued, in hopes of understanding the molecular etiology of diseases caused by these mutations, characterizing the genotype-phenotype relationships, and developing robust models predicting the molecular and clinical outcomes. To achieve these goals better, it is necessary to understand the natural patterns of variation in collagen genes in human populations. We screened exons, flanking intronic regions, and conserved noncoding regions for variations in COL1A1, COL1A2, COL2A1, and COL3A1 in 48 individuals from each of four ethnically diverse populations. We identified 459 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), more than half of which were novel and not found in public databases. Of the 52 SNPs found in coding regions, 15 caused amino acid substitutions while 37 did not. Although the four collagens have similar gene and protein structures, they have different molecular evolutionary characteristics. For example, COL1A1 appears to have been under substantially stronger negative selection than the rest. Phylogenetic analysis also suggests that the four genes have very different evolutionary histories among the different ethnic groups. Our observations suggest that the study of collagen mutations and their relationships with disease phenotypes should be performed in the context of the genetic background of the subjects.",

This study reports the ligand- and cell context-dependent ER(alpha)/Sp1 and ER(beta)/Sp1 action using an E2-responsive construct (pSp1) containing a GC-rich promoter. Both ER(alpha) and ER(beta) proteins physically interact with Sp1 (coimmunoprecipitation) and preferentially bind to the C-terminal region of this protein in pull-down assays. E2- and antiestrogen-dependent transcriptional activation of ER(alpha)/Sp1 was observed in MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and LnCaP cells, but not in HeLa cells. E2 did not affect or significantly decrease ER(beta)/Sp1 action, and antiestrogens had minimal effects in the same 4 cell lines. Exchange of activation function-1 (AF-1) domains of ER subtypes gave chimeric ER(alpha/beta) (AF-1alpha/AF-2beta) and ER(beta/alpha) (AF-1beta/AF-2alpha) proteins that resembled wild-type ER (alpha or beta) in terms of physical association with Sp1 protein. Transcriptional activation studies with chimeric ER(beta/alpha) and ER(alpha/beta) showed that only ER(alpha/beta) can activate transcription from an Sp1 element, not ER(beta/alpha). This indicates that the AF-1 domain from ER(alpha) is responsible for activation at an Sp1 element, independent of ER subtype context. In order to further characterize this observation, deletion constructs in the AF-1 domain of both ER(alpha) and ER(alpha/beta) were made, and transactivation studies indicated that the region between amino acids 79 and 117 of this domain is important for activation at an Sp1 element.",

Recently, ced-1 has been shown to encode a transmembrane protein on phagocytic cells, with two functional sequence motifs in its cytoplasmic tail that are important for engulfment. In this study, using a combination of biochemical approaches and yeast two-hybrid analysis, we present evidence for a physical interaction between GULP/CED-6 and one of the two motifs (NPXY motif) in the cytoplasmic tail of CED-1. The phosphotyrosine binding domain of GULP was necessary and sufficient for this interaction. Since the precise mammalian homologue of CED-1 is not known, we undertook a database search for human proteins that contain the motifs shown to be important for CED-1 function and identified CD91/LRP (low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein) as one candidate. Interestingly, recent studies have also identified CD91/LRP as a receptor involved in the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells in mammals. The GULP phosphotyrosine binding domain was able to specifically interact with one specific NPXY motif in the CD91 cytoplasmic tail. During these studies we have also identified the mouse GULP sequence. These studies suggest a physical link between CED-1 or CD91/LRP and the adapter protein CED-6/GULP during engulfment of apoptotic cells and further elucidate the pathway suggested by the genetic studies.",

Nek2, Nek6, Nek7, and Nek9 are NIMA-related kinases essential for proper mitotic progression. We determined the atomic structure of Nek7 and discovered an autoinhibited conformation that suggests a regulatory mechanism not previously described in kinases. Additionally, Nek2 adopts the same conformation when bound to a drug-like molecule. In both structures, a tyrosine side chain points into the active site, interacts with the activation loop, and blocks the alphaC helix. Tyrosine mutants of Nek7 and the related kinase Nek6 are constitutively active. The activity of Nek6 and Nek7, but not the tyrosine mutant, is increased by interaction with the Nek9 noncatalytic C-terminal domain, suggesting a mechanism in which the tyrosine is released from its autoinhibitory position. The autoinhibitory conformation is common to three Neks and provides a potential target for selective kinase inhibitors.",

        "abstracttext": "The type 1 human immunodeficiency virus Tat protein is a powerful transcriptional activator when bound to an RNA structure (TAR) present at the extreme 5' terminus of viral mRNA. Since transcriptional activation requires binding of Tat to RNA, it has been suggested that Tat enhances initiation or elongation through a direct interaction with cellular transcription factors. Here we show through protein fusion experiments that the previously identified cellular Tat binding protein, TBP-1, although unable to bind DNA, is a strong transcriptional activator when brought into proximity of several promoter elements. Transcriptional activity depends upon the integrity of at least two highly conserved domains: one resembling a nucleotide-binding motif and the other motif common to proteins with helicase activity. Our studies further reveal that TBP-1 represents one member of a large, highly conserved gene family that encodes proteins demonstrating strong amino acid conservation across species. Finally, we identified a second family member that, although 77% similar to TBP-1, does not activate transcription from the promoters examined. This finding, together with the observation that TBP-1 does not activate each promoter examined, suggests that this gene family may encode promoter-specific transcriptional activators.",

        "abstracttext": "Axin, Ccd1 (coiled-coil-DIX1), and dishevelled (Dvl or Dsh) are three known DIX domain proteins that play important roles in Wnt signaling. In addition, Dvl and Axin can activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase JNK via distinct mechanisms, through interaction with MEKK1/4 and Rac GTPase, respectively. Axin utilizes two distinct domains for interaction with MEKK1 and MEKK4. JNK activation by Axin is regulated by several factors in the Wnt pathway, whereas little is known about cross-regulation of Dvl-mediated JNK activation. In the present study, we have investigated whether Ccd1 could play a regulatory role in Axin- and Dvl-mediated JNK activation. Here we show that Ccd1 drastically inhibited JNK activation both by Axin and by Dvl. Although DIX domains are sufficient for dimer formation between Dvl and Ccd1, Ccd1 also required its coiled-coil domain for inhibition of JNK activation by Dvl. Interestingly, Rac remained associated with Dvl heterodimerized with Ccd1. How Ccd1 blocks Rac/Dvl signaling to JNK is unclear. In contrast, Axin, when complexed with Ccd1, did not bind to MEKK1. Furthermore, Ccd1 physically interacted with MEKK4 in their physiological concentrations and prevented MEKK4 from binding to Axin. Reduction of Ccd1 protein by small interfering RNA could elevate JNK signaling as assayed with an AP1-dependent transcriptional reporter. We have therefore demonstrated that Ccd1 inhibits Axin-mediated JNK activation by simultaneously adopting two distinct mechanisms, one through conformational changes that disallow MEKK1 binding and the other via direct sequestration of MEKK4.",

The purified P-LAP was apparently homogeneous on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the apparent molecular weight (Mr) was estimated to be 210,000. By comparing P-LAP activity with cystine aminopeptidase activity, we concluded that both activities were shared by the same molecule. We also examined the hydrolytic activity of P-LAP using naturally occurring peptide hormones and found that the enzyme hydrolyzed oxytocin, vasopressin, and angiotensin III. These results suggest that P-LAP shows oxytocinase activity and plays an important role in the regulation of the plasma level of these hormones during pregnancy.",

The syndrome associated with t(8;13)(p11;q12) results in expression of the ZNF198-FGFR1 fusion tyrosine kinase that plays a pathogenic role in hematopoietic transformation. We found that ZNF198-FGFR1 activated both the AKT and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) prosurvival signaling pathways, resulting in elevated phosphorylation of the AKT target FOXO3a at T32 and BAD at S112, respectively. These phosphorylated residues subsequently sequestered the proapoptotic FOXO3a and BAD to 14-3-3 to prevent apoptosis. We used a peptide-based 14-3-3 competitive antagonist, R18, to disrupt 14-3-3-ligand association. Expression of R18 effectively induced apoptosis in hematopoietic Ba/F3 cells transformed by ZNF198-FGFR1 compared with control cells. Moreover, purified recombinant transactivator of transcription (TAT)-conjugated R18 proteins effectively transduced into human leukemia cells and induced significant apoptosis in KG-1a cells expressing FGFR1OP2-FGFR1 fusion tyrosine kinase but not in control HL-60 and Jurkat T cells. Surprisingly, R18 was only able to dissociate FOXO3a, but not BAD as previously proposed, from 14-3-3 binding and induced apoptosis partially through liberation and reactivation of FOXO3a.

Time-lapse recording of the cell cycle progression of cells expressing kinase-inactive Nek6 reveals mitotic arrest at the metaphase stage prior to cells entering apoptosis.

Co-expression of 4F2hc and y(+)LAT-1 induces the y(+)L activity. This activity is also exerted by another complex composed of 4F2hc and y(+)LAT-2, the latter encoded by the SLC7A6 gene and more ubiquitously expressed than SLC7A7. On the basis of both the pattern of expression and the transport activity, y(+)LAT-2 might compensate for CAA transport when y(+)LAT-1 is defective.

We identified 10,665 unique phosphorylation sites, of which 696 showed TCR-responsive changes. In addition, we analyzed broad trends in phosphorylation data sets to uncover underlying mechanisms associated with T cell activation. We found that, upon stimulation of the TCR, phosphorylation events extensively targeted protein modules involved in all of the salient phenomena associated with T cell activation: patterning of surface proteins, endocytosis of the TCR, formation of the F-actin cup, inside-out activation of integrins, polarization of microtubules, production of cytokines, and alternative splicing of messenger RNA. Further, case-by-case analysis of TCR-responsive phosphorylation sites on proteins belonging to relevant functional modules together with network analysis allowed us to deduce that serine-threonine (S-T) phosphorylation modulated protein-protein interactions (PPIs) in a system-wide fashion. We also provide experimental support for this inference by showing that phosphorylation of tubulin on six distinct serine residues abrogated PPIs during the assembly of microtubules. We propose that modulation of PPIs by stimulus-dependent changes in S-T phosphorylation state is a widespread phenomenon applicable to many other signaling systems.",

Mutations in the type III collagen gene, COL3A1, are associated with the most severe forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. A characteristic feature of type III collagen is the presence of a stabilizing C-terminal cystine knot. Crystal structures of collagen triple helices reported so far contain artificial sequences like (Gly-Pro-Pro)(n) or (Gly-Pro-Hyp)(n). To gain insight into the structural properties exhibited by the natural type III collagen triple helix, we synthesized, crystallized, and determined the structure of a 12-triplet repeating peptide containing the natural type III collagen sequence from residues 991 to 1032 including the C-terminal cystine knot region, to 2.3A resolution. This represents the longest collagen triple helical structure determined to date with a native sequence. Strikingly, the Gly(991)-Gly(1032) structure reveals that the central non-imino acid-containing region adopts 10/3 superhelical properties, whereas the imino acid rich N- and C-terminal regions adhere to a 7/2 superhelical conformation. The structure is consistent with two models for the cystine knot; however, the poor density for the majority of this region suggests that multiple conformations may be adopted. The structure shows that the multiple non-imino acids make several types of direct intrahelical as well as interhelical contacts. The looser superhelical structure of the non-imino acid region of collagen triple helices combined with the extra contacts afforded by ionic and polar residues likely play a role in fibrillar assembly and interactions with other extracellular components.",

        "abstracttext": "Type III collagen is one of the major interstitial collagens and, as such, plays an important role in modulating the structure and function of most tissues. To compare the expression of the type III collagen gene to that of the type I collagen alpha 1(I) and alpha 2(I) genes, cDNAs encoding the 3' one-third of the human alpha 1(III) collagen mRNA were obtained by screening a human fetal lung fibroblast cDNA library with a cloned segment of the chicken alpha 1(III) gene. Northern blot analysis of human fetal lung fibroblast RNA demonstrated two alpha 1(III)-specific mRNAs of sizes 6.6 and 5.8 kilobases, sizes clearly different from those of the type I collagen mRNAs. Analyses of populations of dividing and nondividing human lung fibroblasts revealed that, on a per cell basis, the nondividing population contained twice as much alpha 1(III) mRNA than did the dividing population. The same was true for the type I collagen alpha 1(I) and alpha 2(I) mRNA transcripts. Similar results were obtained when alpha 1(III), alpha 1(I), and alpha 2(I) mRNA transcripts were quantified by using dot blot evaluation of total RNA, Northern analysis of total RNA, and dot blot evaluation of cytoplasmic RNA. Thus, despite the fact that the alpha 1(III) collagen gene is located on a chromosome different from the alpha 1(I) and alpha 2(I) genes, the expression of these three collagen chains appears to be coordinately controlled during periods of rapid and slow fibroblast growth.",

The index patient, a young woman with an acrogeric face, suffered chronic muscle pain and cramps, Achilles tendon retraction, finger flexion contractures and seizures. The mother had similar features and had experienced an ischemic stroke. Biochemical study in cultured fibroblasts and molecular analysis of the COL3A1 gene led to the diagnosis of EDS-IV. A glycine substitution, p.G883V, within the triple helix of the alpha 1(III) chain, was found in the index patient and in the mother. The maternal grandfather and an aunt each had an abdominal aortic aneurysm, the rupture of which was the cause of death in the latter, at 40 years of age. Surprisingly, we found the mutation, as a mosaic, in the asymptomatic maternal grandmother. This expands the clinical spectrum of EDS type IV and confirms that in some families mosaicism can be identified as the source of the mutation.",

DIX Domain Containing 1 (DIXDC1), a novel component of the Wnt pathway, was recently cloned. DIXDC1 is the human homolog of Ccd1, a positive regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway during zebrafish neural patterning. Little has been known about DIXDC1 gene expression regulation. In the present study, we showed that the DIXDC1 protein was induced upon Wnt-3a stimulation, whereas the DIXDC1 mRNA level was not significantly increased after Wnt-3a treatment. Positive DIXDC1 staining was detected in colon cancer cells and was colocalized with beta-catenin staining. However, the DIXDC1 mRNA expression decreased in human colon cancer cells compared to the matched normal colon epithelial cells. Our further investigation showed that the DIXDC1 protein was degraded through the proteasome pathway, and the activation of canonical Wnt signaling decreased the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of both the ectopic and endogenous DIXDC1 protein. In order to explore the possible mechanism of the ubiquitination of DIXDC1, we found that the phosphorylation of DIXDC1 was inhibited by Wnt-3a. Collectively, these results indicate that canonical Wnt/beta-catenin pathway activation might upregulate DIXDC1 through a post-translational mechanism by inhibiting the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of the DIXDC1 protein.",

To fully understand the function and regulation of the proteasome complex, an important step is to elucidate its subunit composition and posttranslational modifications. Toward this goal, a new affinity purification strategy has been developed using a derivative of the HB tag for rapid isolation of the human 26S proteasome complex for subsequent proteomic analysis. The purification of the complex is achieved from stable 293 cell lines expressing a HB-tagged proteasome subunit and by high-affinity streptavidin binding with TEV cleavage elution. The complete composition of the 26S proteasome complex, including recently assigned new subunits, is identified by LC-MS/MS. In addition, all known proteasome activator proteins and components involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation pathway are identified. Aside from the subunit composition, the N-terminal modification and phosphorylation of the proteasome subunits have been characterized. Twelve novel phosphorylation sites from eight subunits have been identified, and N-terminal modifications are determined for 25 subunits, 12 of which have not been previously reported in mammals. We also observe different N-terminal processing of subunit Rpn2, which results in identification of two different N-termini of the protein. This work presents the first comprehensive characterization of the human 26S proteasome complex by affinity purification and tandem mass spectrometry. The detailed proteomic profiling obtained here is significant to future studies aiming at a complete understanding of the structure-function relationship of the human 26S proteasome complex.",

These mechanisms contribute to the ability of insulin to increase hepatic glycogen synthesis. Human G(L) shows >88% amino acid identity to its rat and mouse homologs, with complete conservation of the phosphorylase a binding site. G(L) is highly expressed in the liver and present at appreciable levels in heart tissue of all three species. Surprisingly, G(L) is highly expressed in human skeletal muscle while only being detected at very low levels in rat, mouse, and rabbit skeletal muscle. The amino acid sequence of G(L) predicted from the cDNA is identical in human liver and skeletal muscle and encoded by a gene on chromosome 8 at p23.1. The species-specific difference in the level of expression of G(L) mRNA and protein in skeletal muscle has important implications for understanding the mechanisms by which insulin regulates glycogen synthesis in human skeletal muscle and for questions regarding whether rodents are appropriate models for this purpose.",

        "abstracttext": "The cationic amino acid arginine, due to its positive charge, is usually accumulated in the cytosol. Nevertheless, arginine has to be released by a number of cell types, e.g. kidney cells, which supply other organs with this amino acid, or the endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier which release arginine into the brain. Arginine release in mammalian cells can be mediated by two different transporters, y(+)LAT1 and y(+)LAT2. For insertion into the plasma membrane, these transporters have to be associated with the type-II membrane glycoprotein 4F2hc [Torrents, Estevez, Pineda, Fernandez, Lloberas, Shi, Zorzano and Palacin (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 32437-32445]. The present study elucidates the function and distribution of y(+)LAT2. In contrast to y(+)LAT1, which is expressed mainly in kidney epithelial cells, lung and leucocytes, y(+)LAT2 has a wider tissue distribution, including brain, heart, testis, kidney, small intestine and parotis. When co-expressed with 4F2hc in Xenopus laevis oocytes, y(+)LAT2 mediated uptake of arginine, leucine and glutamine. Arginine uptake was inhibited strongly by lysine, glutamate, leucine, glutamine, methionine and histidine. Mutual inhibition was observed when leucine or glutamine was used as substrate. Inhibition of arginine uptake by neutral amino acids depended on the presence of Na(+), which is a hallmark of y(+)LAT-type transporters. Although arginine transport was inhibited strongly by glutamate, this anionic amino acid was only weakly transported by 4F2hc/y(+)LAT2. Amino acid transport via 4F2hc/y(+)LAT2 followed an antiport mechanism similar to the other members of this new family. Only preloaded arginine could be released in exchange for extracellular amino acids, whereas marginal release of glutamine or leucine was observed under identical conditions. These results indicated that arginine has the highest affinity for the intracellular binding site and that arginine release may be the main physiological function of this transporter.",

In the current study we provide evidence indicating an expanded role for LRP in modulating cellular signaling events. Our results show that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) BB induces a transient tyrosine phosphorylation of the LRP cytoplasmic domain in a process dependent on PDGF receptor activation and c-Src family kinase activity. Other growth factors, including basic fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor, insulin-like growth factor-1, were unable to mediate tyrosine phosphorylation of LRP. The basis for this selectivity may result from the ability of LRP to bind PDGFBB, because surface plasmon resonance experiments demonstrated that only PDGF, and not basic fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor, or insulin-like growth factor-1, bound to purified LRP immobilized on a sensor chip. The use of LRP mini-receptor mutants as well as in vitro phosphorylation studies demonstrated that the tyrosine located within the second NPXY motif found in the LRP cytoplasmic domain is the primary site of tyrosine phosphorylation by Src and Src family kinases. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that PDGF-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of LRPs cytoplasmic domain results in increased association of the adaptor protein Shc with LRP and that Shc recognizes the second NPXY motif within LRPs cytoplasmic domain. In the accompanying paper, Boucher et al. (Boucher, P., Liu, P. V., Gotthardt, M., Hiesberger, T., Anderson, R. G. W., and Herz, J. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 15507-15513) reveal that LRP is found in caveolae along with the PDGF receptor.

Disruption of EHD2 or EHBP1 function by small interfering RNA-mediated gene silencing inhibits endocytosis of transferrin into EEA1-positive endosomes as well as GLUT4 endocytosis into cultured adipocytes. EHD2 localizes with cortical actin filaments, whereas EHBP1 contains a putative actin-binding calponin homology domain. High expression of EHD2 or EHBP1 in intact cells mediates extensive actin reorganization.

We have used a baculovirus expression system to produce high levels of a soluble, extracellular domain form of the FGF receptor (EC-FGF receptor).

Furthermore, binding of basic FGF to the EC-FGF receptor was shown to be significantly enhanced by heparin.

        "abstracttext": "The inositol trisphosphate (InsP(3)) receptor (InsP(3)R) is a ubiquitously expressed intracellular Ca(2+) channel that mediates complex cytoplasmic Ca(2+) signals, regulating diverse cellular processes, including synaptic plasticity. Activation of the InsP(3)R channel is normally thought to require binding of InsP(3) derived from receptor-mediated activation of phosphatidylinositol lipid hydrolysis. Here we identify a family of neuronal Ca(2+)-binding proteins as high-affinity protein agonists of the InsP(3)R, which bind to the channel and activate gating in the absence of InsP(3). CaBP/caldendrin, a subfamily of the EF-hand-containing neuronal calcium sensor family of calmodulin-related proteins, bind specifically to the InsP(3)-binding region of all three InsP(3)R channel isoforms with high affinity (K(a) approximately 25 nM) in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner (K(a) approximately 1 microM). Binding activates single-channel gating as efficaciously as InsP(3), dependent on functional EF-hands in CaBP. In contrast, calmodulin neither bound with high affinity nor activated channel gating. CaBP1 and the type 1 InsP(3)R associate in rat whole brain and cerebellum lysates, and colocalize extensively in subcellular regions in cerebellar Purkinje neurons. Thus, InsP(3)R-mediated Ca(2+) signaling in cells is possible even in the absence of InsP(3) generation, a process that may be particularly important in responding to and shaping changes in intracellular Ca(2+) concentration by InsP(3)-independent pathways and for localizing InsP(3)-mediated Ca(2+) signals to individual synapses.",

Of these, alphavbeta6 is a likely candidate for use as a receptor by FMDV as it is expressed on epithelial cells, which correlates with the tissue tropism of the virus. In this report, we show that human colon carcinoma cells (SW480) that are normally nonpermissive for FMDV become susceptible to infection as a result of transfection with the integrin beta6 subunit and expression of alphavbeta6 at the cell surface. Integrin alphavbeta6 is the major site for virus attachment on the beta6-transfected cells, and binding to alphavbeta6 serves to increase the rate of virus entry into these cells. In addition, we show that virus binding and infection of the beta6-transfected cells is mediated through an RGD-dependent interaction that is specifically inhibited by a monoclonal antibody (10D5) that recognizes alphavbeta6.

It represents 99.4% of the euchromatic DNA and includes one megabase of heterochromatic sequence within the pericentromeric region of the short and long arm of the chromosome. Sequence annotation revealed 1,357 genes, of which 816 are protein coding, and 430 are pseudogenes. We observed widespread occurrence of overlapping coding genes (either strand) and identified 67 antisense transcripts. Our analysis suggests that both inter- and intrachromosomal segmental duplications have impacted on the gene count on chromosome 10. Multispecies comparative analysis indicated that we can readily annotate the protein-coding genes with current resources. We estimate that over 95% of all coding exons were identified in this study. Assessment of single base changes between the human chromosome 10 and chimpanzee sequence revealed nonsense mutations in only 21 coding genes with respect to the human sequence.",

Fullness rates were increased to about 80% by combination of the oligo-capping method and ATGpr, software for prediction of translation start point and the coding potential. Then, using 5'-end single-pass sequences, cDNAs having the signal sequence were selected by PSORT ('signal sequence trap'). We also applied 'secretion or membrane protein-related keyword trap' based on the result of BLAST search against the SWISS-PROT database for the cDNAs which could not be selected by PSORT. Using the above procedures, 789 cDNAs were primarily selected and subjected to full-length sequencing, and 334 of these cDNAs were finally selected as novel. Most of the cDNAs (295 cDNAs: 88.3%) were predicted to encode secretion or membrane proteins. In particular, 165(80.5%) of the 205 cDNAs selected by PSORT were predicted to have signal sequences, while 70 (54.2%) of the 129 cDNAs selected by 'keyword trap' preserved the secretion or membrane protein-related keywords. Many important cDNAs were obtained, including transporters, receptors, and ligands, involved in significant cellular functions. Thus, an efficient method of selecting secretion or membrane protein-encoding cDNAs was developed by combining the above four procedures.",

The complete sequence of the protein containing 4544 amino acids is presented. From the sequence a remarkable resemblance to the LDL-receptor and epidermal growth factor (EGF) precursor is apparent. Three types of repeating sequence motifs entirely account for the extracellular domain of the molecule. These are arranged in a manner resembling four copies of the ligand binding and the EGF-precursor homologous region of the LDL-receptor. Following a proline-rich segment of 17 amino acids are found six consecutive repeats with close homology to EGF. A single membrane-spanning segment precedes a carboxy-terminal 'tail' of 100 amino acids. This contains two seven-amino acid sequences with striking homology to the cytoplasmic tail of the LDL-receptor in the region that contains the signal for clustering into coated pits. The mRNA for this protein is most abundant in liver, brain and lung. By using an antibody raised against a 13-amino acid peptide corresponding to the deduced amino acid sequence of the carboxy-terminus of the protein we have demonstrated its existence on the cell surface and its abundance in liver. Like the LDL-receptor this protein also strongly binds calcium, a cation absolutely required for binding of apolipoproteins B and E to their receptors. We propose that this LDL-receptor related protein (LRP) is a recycling lipoprotein receptor with possible growth-modulating effects.",

Here we describe the crystal structure of the activated tyrosine kinase domain of FGFR1 in complex with a phospholipase Cgamma fragment. The structural and biochemical data and experiments with cultured cells show that the selectivity of phospholipase Cgamma binding and signaling via activated FGFR1 are determined by interactions between a secondary binding site on an SH2 domain and a region in FGFR1 kinase domain in a phosphorylation independent manner. These experiments reveal a mechanism for how SH2 domain selectivity is regulated in vivo to mediate a specific cellular process.",

The receptor is a glycoprotein composed of a 150-kDa alpha and a 115-kDa beta subunit. The alpha subunit consists of two disulfide-bonded chains of 125 kDa and 25 kDa. cDNA clones were isolated for the alpha subunit of the vitronectin receptor from a phage lambda gt11 expression library made with RNA from a human fibroblast cell line, IMR-90. The identity of the clones that had been selected from the library based on immunological criteria was verified by comparison of DNA and protein sequences. NH2-terminal sequences were obtained for each of the alpha-subunit chains. The sequence of the 25-kDa chain of the alpha subunit was found in a cDNA clone, and the amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA establishes the complete amino acid sequence of the 25-kDa chain. This chain contains a membrane-spanning domain as well as a putative intracytoplasmic region that is 32 amino acids long and consists mostly of polar amino acids. Comparison of the cDNA and protein sequences shows that the 25-kDa chain is generated by proteolytic cleavage of an alpha-subunit precursor, the partial sequence of which is contained in the cDNA clones. These clones contain 1910 base pairs of open reading frame and a 3' untranslated sequence. RNA blot hybridization detected one transcript of about 7 kilobases in RNA from fibroblastic and epithelial cells. Together, the cDNA clones cover 4442 bases of this RNA. The alpha-subunit sequence showed strong homology with the sequence of the alpha subunit of fibronectin receptor. Moreover, the NH2-terminal protein sequence of the 125-kDa chain was homologous with the NH2-terminal sequences of two other cell surface proteins, lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1) and macrophage antigen 1 (Mac-1), which have been implicated as receptors for adhesion proteins of leukocytes.

However, it is still unclear, which binding partners Ena/VASP proteins may have at lamellipodia tips and how their recruitment to these cellular protrusions is regulated. Here, we report the identification of a novel protein with high similarity to the C. elegans MIG-10 protein, which we termed PREL1 (Proline Rich EVH1 Ligand). PREL1 is a 74 kDa protein and shares homology with the Grb7-family of signalling adaptors. We show that PREL1 directly binds to Ena/VASP proteins and co-localizes with them at lamellipodia tips and at focal adhesions in response to Ras activation. Moreover, PREL1 directly binds to activated Ras in a phosphoinositide-dependent manner. Thus, our data pinpoint PREL1 as the first direct link between Ras signalling and cytoskeletal remodelling via Ena/VASP proteins during cell migration and spreading.",

It serves to transfer electrons from NADPH to thioredoxin leading to its reduction. Interestingly, recent work has indicated that thioredoxin reductase can regulate the activity of transcription factors such as p53, hypoxia-inducible factor, and AP-1. Here, we describe that an alternative splicing variant of thioredoxin reductase (TrxR1b) containing an LXXLL peptide motif, is implicated in direct binding to nuclear receptors. In vitro interaction studies revealed direct interaction of the TrxR1b with the estrogen receptors alpha and beta. Confocal microscopy analysis showed nuclear colocalization of the TrxR1b with both estrogen receptor alpha and beta in estradiol-17beta-treated cells. Transcriptional studies demonstrated that TrxR1b can affect estrogen-dependent gene activation differentially at classical estrogen response elements as compared with AP-1 response elements. Based on these results, we propose a model where thioredoxin reductase directly influences the estrogen receptor-coactivator complex assembly on non-classical estrogen response elements such as AP-1. In summary, our results suggest that TrxR1b is an important modulator of estrogen signaling.",

To assess the role of tyrosine 766 in endothelial cell function, we generated endothelial cells expressing a chimeric receptor, composed of the extracellular domain of the PDGF receptor-alpha and the intracellular domain of FGFR-1. Mutation of tyrosine 766 to phenylalanine prevented PLC-gamma activation and resulted in a reduced phosphorylation of FRS2 and reduced activation of the Ras/MEK/MAPK pathway relative to the wild-type chimeric receptor. However, FGFR-1-mediated MAPK activation was not dependent on PKC activation or intracellular calcium, both downstream mediators of PLC-gamma activation. We report that the adaptor protein Shb is also able to bind tyrosine 766 in the FGFR-1, via its SH2 domain, resulting in its subsequent phosphorylation. Overexpression of an SH2 domain mutant Shb caused a dramatic reduction in FGFR-1-mediated FRS2 phosphorylation with concomitant perturbment of the Ras/MEK/MAPK pathway. Expression of the chimeric receptor mutant and the Shb SH2 domain mutant resulted in a similar reduction in FGFR-1-mediated mitogenicity. We conclude, that Shb binds to tyrosine 766 in the FGFR-1 and regulates FGF-mediated mitogenicity via FRS2 phosphorylation and the subsequent activation of the Ras/MEK/MAPK pathway.",

It is thought that the heavy chain is mainly involved in the trafficking of the complex to the plasma membrane, whereas the transport process itself is catalysed by the light chain. The 4F2 heavy chain (4F2hc) associates with at least six different light chains to induce distinct amino acid-transport activites. To test if the light chains are specifically recognized and to identify domains involved in the recognition of light chains, C-terminally truncated mutants of 4F2hc were constructed and co-expressed with the light chains LAT1, LAT2 and y(+)LAT2. The truncated isoform T1, comprised of only 133 amino acids that form the cytosolic N-terminus and the transmembrane helix, displayed only a slight reduction in its ability to promote LAT1 expression at the membrane surface compared with the 529 amino acid wild-type 4F2hc protein. Co-expression of increasingly larger 4F2hc mutants caused a delayed translocation of LAT1. In contrast to the weak effects of 4F2hc truncations on LAT1 expression, surface expression of LAT2 and y(+)LAT2 was almost completely lost with all truncated heavy chains. Co-expression of LAT1 together with the other light chains did not result in displacement of LAT2 and y(+)LAT2. The results suggest that extracellular domains of the heavy chain are responsible mainly for recognition of light chains other than LAT1 and that the extracellular domain ensures proper translocation to the plasma membrane.",

A previously reported spontaneous Itpr1 mutation in mice causes a phenotype identical to that observed here. In both models in-frame deletion within Itpr1 leads to a decrease in the normally high level of Itpr1 expression in cerebellar Purkinje cells. Spinocerebellar ataxia 15 (SCA15), a human autosomal dominant disorder, maps to the genomic region containing ITPR1; however, to date no causal mutations had been identified. Because ataxia is a prominent feature in Itpr1 mutant mice, we performed a series of experiments to test the hypothesis that mutation at ITPR1 may be the cause of SCA15. We show here that heterozygous deletion of the 5' part of the ITPR1 gene, encompassing exons 1-10, 1-40, and 1-44 in three studied families, underlies SCA15 in humans.",

We first show that ERalpha and ERbeta homo- and heterodimers form in vivo independently of the presence of 17beta-estradiol (E2) or antiestrogens. We then demonstrate that E2 enhances interactions between ERalpha and the RIDs of SRC-1 and SRC-3, whereas the interaction between ERalpha with the SRC-2 RID is ligand independent. The transcriptionally inactive mutant ERalphaL539A showed no interaction with all three SRC RIDs. Similarly, treatment with the antagonists 4-hydroxytamoxifen and EM-652 abolished all interactions between ERalpha and the SRC RIDs. FRET data also demonstrate that, in contrast to ERalpha, ERbeta interacts with all three SRC RIDs in a ligand-independent manner. However, these interactions were further enhanced or stabilized by E2, whereas the antiestrogen EM-652 abolished all interactions. In the presence of both ERalpha and ERbeta, E2 treatment led to the recruitment of SRC RIDs to the nuclei. Finally, expression of the oncogenic activated ErbB-2/Neu protein specifically enhanced ERalpha but not ERbeta interactions with SRC RIDs to an extent similar to E2-stimulated interactions.

Using NMR spectroscopy, we show here that the PINCH LIM4 domain, while maintaining the conserved LIM scaffold, recognizes the third SH3 domain of another adaptor protein, Nck2 (also called Nckbeta or Grb4), in a manner distinct from that of the LIM1 domain. Point mutation of LIM residues in the SH3-binding interface disrupted LIM-SH3 interaction and substantially impaired localization of PINCH to focal adhesions. These data provide novel structural insight into LIM domain-mediated protein-protein recognition and demonstrate that the PINCH-Nck2 interaction is an important component of the focal adhesion assembly during integrin signaling.",

        "abstracttext": "In this series of projects of sequencing human cDNA clones which correspond to relatively long transcripts, we newly determined the entire sequences of 100 cDNA clones which were screened on the basis of the potentiality of coding for large proteins in vitro. The cDNA libraries used were the fractions with average insert sizes from 5.3 to 7.0 kb of the size-fractionated cDNA libraries from human brain. The randomly sampled clones were single-pass sequenced from both the ends to select clones that are not registered in the public database. Then their protein-coding potentialities were examined by an in vitro transcription/translation system, and the clones that generated proteins larger than 60 kDa were entirely sequenced. Each clone gave a distinct open reading frame (ORF), and the length of the ORF was roughly coincident with the approximate molecular mass of the in vitro product estimated from its mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The average size of the cDNA clones sequenced was 6.1 kb, and that of the ORFs corresponded to 1200 amino acid residues. By computer-assisted analysis of the sequences with DNA and protein-motif databases (GenBank and PROSITE databases), the functions of at least 73% of the gene products could be anticipated, and 88% of them (the products of 64 clones) were assigned to the functional categories of proteins relating to cell signaling/communication, nucleic acid managing, and cell structure/motility. The expression profiles in a variety of tissues and chromosomal locations of the sequenced clones have been determined. According to the expression spectra, approximately 11 genes appeared to be predominantly expressed in brain. Most of the remaining genes were categorized into one of the following classes: either the expression occurs in a limited number of tissues (31 genes) or the expression occurs ubiquitously in all but a few tissues (47 genes).",

Whereas in the mouse the Surf-2 and Surf-4 genes overlap at their 3' ends, the human Surf-2 and Surf-4 genes have been found to be separated by 302 bp due to a much shorter 3' untranslated region in the human Surf-2 gene. The distance between the 3' ends of the human Surf-1 and Surf-3 genes is 374 bp, and the distance between the 5' ends of the human Surf-3 and Surf-5 genes is only 112 bp.

Of the seven family members, the best characterized are basic and acidic FGF. In addition to their mitogenic effects, they participate in angiogenesis, differentiation and maintenance of survival of neurons, cell migration and embryonal development. Of all family members, keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) is unique in that it is a specific mitogen for epithelial cells and does not interact with the FGF receptor of fibroblasts. To study the interactions between KGF and its receptor, we isolated KGF and FGF receptors from keratinocytes and fibroblasts, respectively. In the course of this study, we isolated five different variants of the FGF receptor from human fibroblasts and showed that all were derived from a single genetic locus. Four of these variants encode transmembrane receptors and can be divided into two subgroups that differ from one another with respect to the number (two or three) of immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains. Within each subgroup, one receptor differed from the other by the presence of a two-codon insertion. Thus, all the variations among the four isoforms are localized to their ligand binding domains. The fifth isoform encodes a molecule truncated just 3' to the first Ig-like domain and thus could be secreted from the cell. The transcripts encoding the long and short isoforms were found to be expressed in many cell types, but their relative levels of expression varied greatly depending on the cell type. These findings indicate that alternative splicing generates diverse FGF receptor isoforms in human cells.",

Here, we show that, although both proteins interact with and co-activate ERalpha in reporter gene assays, small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of p72, but not p68, results in a significant inhibition of oestrogen-dependent transcription of endogenous ERalpha-responsive genes and oestrogen-dependent growth of MCF-7 and ZR75-1 breast cancer cells. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining of ERalpha-positive primary breast cancers for p68 and p72 indicate that p72 expression is associated with an increased period of relapse-free and overall survival (P=0.006 and 0.016, respectively), as well as being inversely associated with Her2 expression (P=0.008). Conversely, p68 shows no association with relapse-free period, or overall survival, but it is associated with an increased expression of Her2 (P=0.001), AIB-1 (P<0.001) and higher tumour grade (P=0.044). Our data thus highlight a crucial role for p72 in ERalpha co-activation and oestrogen-dependent cell growth and provide evidence in support of distinct but important roles for both p68 and p72 in regulating ERalpha activity in breast cancer.",

Surf4 was found to interact with endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC)-53 and p24 proteins.

Live imaging showed decreased stability of ERGIC clusters after knockdown of p25. Silencing of Surf4/ERGIC-53 or p25 resulted in partial redistribution of coat protein (COP) I but not Golgi matrix proteins to the cytosol and partial resistance of the cis-Golgi to brefeldin A.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, five P4-ATPases are localized to specific cellular compartments and are required for vesicle-mediated protein transport from these compartments, suggesting a role for phospholipid translocation in vesicular transport. The human genome encodes 14 P4-ATPases and three CDC50 proteins. However, the subcellular localization of human P4-ATPases and their interactions with CDC50 proteins are poorly understood. Here, we show that class 5 (ATP10A, ATP10B, and ATP10D) and class 6 (ATP11A, ATP11B, and ATP11C) P4-ATPases require CDC50 proteins, primarily CDC50A, for their exit from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and final subcellular localization. In contrast, class 2 P4-ATPases (ATP9A and ATP9B) are able to exit the ER in the absence of exogenous CDC50 expression: ATP9B, but not ATP11B, was able to exit the ER despite depletion of CDC50 proteins by RNAi. Although ATP9A and ATP9B show a high overall sequence similarity, ATP9A localizes to endosomes and the trans-Golgi network (TGN), whereas ATP9B localizes exclusively to the TGN. A chimeric ATP9 protein in which the N-terminal cytoplasmic region of ATP9A was replaced with the corresponding region of ATP9B was localized exclusively to the Golgi. These results indicate that ATP9B is able to exit the ER and localize to the TGN independently of CDC50 proteins and that this protein contains a Golgi localization signal in its N-terminal cytoplasmic region.",

However, a persistent problem has been that not all findings previously reported in estrogen-stimulated cell proliferation can be explained through the known properties of the different estrogen receptors described. As the consequence of a search for alternative mechanisms to account for these different findings, we have now identified, cloned, and expressed in HEK 293 cells a previously unrecognized 36-kDa variant of hER-alpha66, termed hER-alpha36. hER-alpha36 differs from hER-alpha66 since it lacks both transcriptional activation domains (AF-1 and AF-2) but it retains the DNA-binding domain, and partial dimerization and ligand-binding domains of hER-alpha66. It also contains three myristoylation sites postulated to direct ER-alpha36 to the plasma membrane. It is concluded that ER-alpha36 is a unique variant of ER-alpha66; ER-alpha36 is predicted to function as a dominant-negative effector of hER-alpha66-mediated estrogen-responsive gene pathways and has the potential to trigger membrane-initiated mitogenic estrogen signaling.",

While many studies demonstrate that ER and NF-\u03baB can repress each other, we previously identified a gene signature that is synergistically upregulated by these two factors in more aggressive luminal B breast tumors. Herein, we examine a novel mechanism of cross talk between ER and NF-\u03baB that results in the upregulation of the antiapoptotic gene BIRC3 (also known as cIAP2). We demonstrate that NF-\u03baB, acting through two response elements, is required for ER recruitment to an adjacent estrogen response element (ERE) in the BIRC3 promoter. This effect is accompanied by a major increase in NF-\u03baB-dependent histone acetylation around the ERE. Interestingly, CBP, a histone acetyltransferase previously implicated in repressive interactions between ER and NF-\u03baB, plays a permissive role by promoting histone acetylation and ER recruitment, as well as enhanced expression of BIRC3. These findings suggest a new gene regulatory mechanism by which inflammation and NF-\u03baB activation can influence ER recruitment to inherently inactive ER binding sites. This fine-tuning mechanism may explain how two factors that generally repress each other's activity may work together on certain genes to promote breast cancer cell survival and tumor progression.",

The conservation of these domains is such that all three proteins recognize related DNA sequences, and all are capable of dimerizing with other family members. Here we describe two additional Ikaros family proteins, Eos and Pegasus. Eos is most highly related to Helios and shares its DNA binding and protein association properties. Pegasus is related to other Ikaros proteins in its C-terminal dimerization domain but contains a divergent N-terminal zinc finger domain. Pegasus self-associates and binds to other family members but recognizes distinct DNA-binding sites. Eos and Pegasus repress the expression of reporter genes containing their recognition elements.

Here we report on the role of EDG1 as a coregulator of ERalpha transcriptional activity. We observe an interaction between EDG1 and ERalpha. EDG1 inhibits the transcriptional activity of ERalpha and this is dependent upon the C-terminus of EDG1. The C-terminus of EDG1/HEXIM1 was recently shown to inhibit the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) by interacting with the cyclin T1 subunit. Here we show that ERalpha interacts with cyclin T1, cyclin T1 and ER co-occupancy on the promoter region of an ER target gene, and that this interaction plays an important role in ERalpha-induced gene expression. The interaction of ERalpha with cyclin T1 also allows ERalpha to compete with EDG1 for cyclin T1, and may release cyclin T1 from EDG1 repression. Conversely, increased EDG1 expression results in inhibition of cyclin T1 recruitment and ERalpha DNA binding.

Furthermore, depletion of Fbw7 by RNA interference increased both the abundance and transactivation activity of c-Myc. Accumulation of c-Myc was also apparent in mouse Fbw7-/- embryonic stem cells. These observations suggest that two F-box proteins, Fbw7 and Skp2, differentially regulate c-Myc stability by targeting MB1 and MB2, respectively.",

The physiological effects of these steroids are mediated by a ligand-inducible nuclear transcription factor, the oestrogen receptor (ER). Hormone binding to the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of the ER initiates a series of molecular events culminating in the activation or repression of target genes. Transcriptional regulation arises from the direct interaction of the ER with components of the cellular transcription machinery. Here we report the crystal structures of the LBD of ER in complex with the endogenous oestrogen, 17beta-oestradiol, and the selective antagonist raloxifene, at resolutions of 3.1 and 2.6 A, respectively. The structures provide a molecular basis for the distinctive pharmacophore of the ER and its catholic binding properties. Agonist and antagonist bind at the same site within the core of the LBD but demonstrate different binding modes. In addition, each class of ligand induces a distinct conformation in the transactivation domain of the LBD, providing structural evidence of the mechanism of antagonism.",

In situ hybridization confirmed that both genes were expressed within lesions but not within nonlesional aortic tissue.

Both genes appear to contain an atypical Hsp70 ATPase domain. The BLAST search also revealed that both genes were more similar to primitive eukaryote and prokaryote than mammalian Hsp70s, making these two genes distant members of the mammalian Hsp70 family.

Nck is a SH3- and SH2-containing adaptor protein implicated in coordinating various signaling pathways, including those of growth factor receptors and cell adhesion receptors. We report here the identification, cloning, and characterization of a widely expressed, Nck-related adaptor protein termed Nck-2. Nck-2 comprises primarily three N-terminal SH3 domains and one C-terminal SH2 domain. We show that Nck-2 interacts with PINCH, a LIM-only protein implicated in integrin-linked kinase signaling. The PINCH-Nck-2 interaction is mediated by the fourth LIM domain of PINCH and the third SH3 domain of Nck-2. Furthermore, we show that Nck-2 is capable of recognizing several key components of growth factor receptor kinase-signaling pathways including EGF receptors, PDGF receptor-beta, and IRS-1. The association of Nck-2 with EGF receptors was regulated by EGF stimulation and involved largely the SH2 domain of Nck-2, although the SH3 domains of Nck-2 also contributed to the complex formation. The association of Nck-2 with PDGF receptor-beta was dependent on PDGF activation and was mediated solely by the SH2 domain of Nck-2. Additionally, we have detected a stable association between Nck-2 and IRS-1 that was mediated primarily via the second and third SH3 domain of Nck-2. Thus, Nck-2 associates with PINCH and components of different growth factor receptor-signaling pathways via distinct mechanisms. Finally, we provide evidence indicating that a fraction of the Nck-2 and/or Nck-1 proteins are associated with the cytoskeleton. These results identify a novel Nck-related SH2- and SH3-domain-containing protein and suggest that it may function as an adaptor protein connecting the growth factor receptor-signaling pathways with the integrin-signaling pathways.",

The cDNA isolated by two-hybrid screening corresponded to a novel beta2-syntrophin isoform with a predicted molecular mass of 28 kDa. This isoform included the PDZ domain, but not the C-terminal region, which in full-length beta2-syntrophin is responsible for binding dystrophin-related proteins. In vitro binding of the beta2-syntrophin PDZ domain to ICA512 required both ICA512's C-terminal region and an internal polypeptide preceding its tyrosine phosphatase-like domain. Immunomicroscopy and co-immunoprecipitations from insulinoma INS-1 cells confirmed the occurrence of ICA512-beta2-syntrophin complexes in vivo. ICA512 also interacted in vitro with the PDZ domain of nNOS and ICA512-nNOS complexes were co-immunoprecipitated from INS-1 cells.

We have identified the 193-kD vault protein by its interaction with the MVP in a yeast two-hybrid screen and confirmed its identity by peptide sequence analysis. Analysis of the protein sequence revealed a region of approximately 350 amino acids that shares 28% identity with the catalytic domain of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). PARP is a nuclear protein that catalyzes the formation of ADP-ribose polymers in response to DNA damage. The catalytic domain of p193 was expressed and purified from bacterial extracts. Like PARP, this domain is capable of catalyzing a poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation reaction; thus, the 193-kD protein is a new PARP. Purified vaults also contain the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation activity, indicating that the assembled particle retains enzymatic activity. Furthermore, we show that one substrate for this vault-associated PARP activity is the MVP. Immunofluorescence and biochemical data reveal that p193 protein is not entirely associated with the vault particle, suggesting that it may interact with other protein(s).

Finally, third-stage phosphorylation of a second activation loop tyrosine leads to an additional 10-fold stimulation of FGFR1 catalytic activity. In this report, we show that sequential autophosphorylation of five tyrosines in the FGFR1 kinase domain is under kinetic control, mediated by both the amino acid sequence surrounding the tyrosines and their locations within the kinase structure, and, moreover, that phosphoryl transfer is the rate-limiting step. Furthermore, the strict order of autophosphorylation is disrupted by a glioblastoma-derived, oncogenic FGFR1 point mutation in the kinase domain.

In contrast, hERalpha46 is a powerful inhibitor of hERalpha66 in a cell context where the transactivating function of AF-1 predominates over AF-2.

We demonstrate that epidermal growth factor (EGF) and TGF alpha transactivate the GPR30 promoter and accordingly up-regulate GPR30 mRNA and protein levels only in endometrial and tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells. These effects exerted by EGF and TGF alpha were dependent on EGF receptor (EGFR) expression and activation and involved phosphorylation of the Tyr(1045) and Tyr(1173) EGFR sites. Using gene-silencing experiments and specific pharmacological inhibitors, we have ascertained that EGF and TGF alpha induce GPR30 expression through the EGFR/ERK transduction pathway, and the recruitment of c-fos to the activator protein-1 site located within GPR30 promoter sequence. Interestingly, we show that functional cross talk of GPR30 with both activated EGFR and ER alpha relies on a physical interaction among these receptors, further extending the potential of estrogen to trigger a complex stimulatory signaling network in hormone-sensitive tumors. Given that EGFR/HER2 overexpression is associated with tamoxifen resistance, our data may suggest that ligand-activated EGFR could contribute to the failure of tamoxifen therapy also by up-regulating GPR30, which in turn could facilitates the action of estrogen. In addition, important for resistance is the ability of tamoxifen to bind to and activate GPR30, the expression of which is up-regulated by EGFR activation. Our results emphasize the need for new endocrine agents able to block widespread actions of estrogen without exerting any stimulatory activity on transduction pathways shared by the steroid and growth factor-signaling networks.",

Here we show that archipelago mutant cells have persistently elevated levels of Cyclin E protein without increased levels of cyclin E RNA. They are under-represented in G1 fractions and continue to proliferate when their wild-type neighbours become quiescent. The Archipelago protein binds directly to Cyclin E and probably targets it for ubiquitin-mediated degradation.

ERbeta is highly homologous to the \"classical\" estrogen receptor alpha (here referred to as ERalpha), has been shown to bind estrogens with an affinity similar to that of ERalpha, and activates expression of reporter genes containing estrogen response elements in an estrogen-dependent manner. Here we describe functional studies comparing the DNA binding abilities of human ERalpha and beta in gel shift assays. We show that DNA binding by ERalpha and beta are similarly affected by elevated temperature in the absence of ligand or in the presence of 17beta-estradiol and the partial estrogen agonist 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen. In the absence of ligand, DNA binding by ERalpha and beta is rapidly lost at 37 degrees C, while in the presence of 17beta-estradiol and 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen, the loss in DNA binding at elevated temperature is much more gradual. We show that the loss in DNA binding is not due to degradation of the receptor proteins. However, while the complete antagonist ICI 182, 780 does not \"protect\" human ERalpha (hERalpha) from loss of DNA binding at elevated temperature in vitro, it does appear to protect human ERbeta (hERbeta), suggestive of differences in the way ICI 182, 780 acts on hERalpha and beta. We further report that ERalpha and beta can dimerize with each other, the DNA binding domain of hERalpha being sufficient for dimerization with hERbeta. Cell and promoter-specific transcription activation by ERalpha has been shown to be dependent on the differential action of the N- and C-terminal transcription activation functions AF-1 and AF-2, respectively.

We now confirm that, due to alternative splicing, the 46-kDa endothelial cell protein (ER46) is an amino-terminal truncated product of full-length ER alpha (ER66). ER46 is expressed in the plasma membrane, cytosol, and nucleus of resting, estrogen-deprived cells. Flow cytometric and immunofluorescence microscopic analyses demonstrated that the ER46 C but not N terminus is Ab-accessible in the plasma membrane. Inhibition of palmitoylation with tunicamycin and [(3)H]palmitic acid labeling demonstrated an estrogen-induced, palmitoylation-dependent plasma membrane ER46 recruitment, with reorganization into caveolae. In reconstituted, estrogen-stimulated COS-7 (ER-null) cells, membrane ER46 more efficiently triggered membrane eNOS phosphorylation than ER66. Conversely, ER66 more efficiently mediated estrogen response element reporter-gene transactivation than ER46. These results demonstrate that ER46 is localized and further dynamically targeted to the plasma membrane in a palmitoylation-dependent manner. ER46 more efficiently modulates membrane-initiated estrogen actions, including eNOS activation, than full-length ER66.

Exposure of cells from patients with the human genetic disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), characterized by hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation, failed to change the levels of InsP3R type 1 mRNA and, as expected, there was no increase in InsP3R type 1 protein in A-T cells in response to radiation exposure. Protein levels for two other InsP3Rs, types 2 and 3, were observed to increase in control and A-T cells after exposure to ionizing radiation. The induction of the InsP3R type 1, which is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum, may play an important role in radiation signal transduction.",

Here we report that LT binds directly to Fbw7, the substrate recognition component of the SCF(Fbw7) ubiquitin ligase and a human tumor suppressor. LT binding mislocalizes the nucleolar Fbw7gamma isoform to the nucleoplasm. Interestingly, the binding of LT to Fbw7 occurs via a decoy phospho-epitope within the C terminus of LT that closely mimics the consensus Cdc4 phospho-degron found within Fbw7 substrates. We demonstrate that, using this mode of interaction, LT can interfere with Fbw7-driven cyclin E turnover in vivo and causes increased cyclin E-associated kinase activity. Our data suggest that LT competes with cellular proteins for Fbw7 binding in a substrate-like fashion.",

In a search for proteins involved in regulation of the proteasome, we affinity purified the 19S regulatory complex from HeLa cells and identified a novel protein of 43 kDa in size as an associated protein. Immunoprecipitation analyses suggested that this protein specifically interacted with the proteasomal ATPases. Hence the protein was named proteasomal ATPase-associated factor 1 (PAAF1). Immunoaffinity purification of PAAF1 confirmed its interaction with the 19S regulatory complex and further showed that the 19S regulatory complex bound with PAAF1 was not stably associated with the 20S core. Overexpression of PAAF1 in HeLa cells decreased the level of the 20S core associated with the 19S complex in a dose-dependent fashion, suggesting that PAAF1 binding to proteasomal ATPases inhibited the assembly of the 26S proteasome. Proteasomal degradation assays using reporters based on green fluorescent protein revealed that overexpression of PAAF1 inhibited the proteasome activity in vivo. Furthermore, the suppression of PAAF1 expression that is mediated by small inhibitory RNA enhanced the proteasome activity.

        "abstracttext": "Activation of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling is initiated by a multiprotein complex formation between FGF, FGF receptor (FGFR), and heparan sulfate proteoglycan on the cell membrane. Cross-talk with other factors could affect this complex assembly and modulate the biological response of cells to FGF. We have previously demonstrated that anosmin-1, a glycosylated extracellular matrix protein, interacts with the FGFR1 signaling complex and enhances its activity in an IIIc isoform-specific and HS-dependent manner. The molecular mechanism of anosmin-1 action on FGFR1 signaling, however, remains unknown. Here, we show that anosmin-1 directly binds to FGFR1 with high affinity. This interaction involves domains in the N terminus of anosmin-1 (cysteine-rich region, whey acidic protein-like domain and the first fibronectin type III domain) and the D2-D3 extracellular domains of FGFR1. In contrast, anosmin-1 binds to FGFR2IIIc with much lower affinity and displays negligible binding to FGFR3IIIc. We also show that FGFR1-bound anosmin-1, although capable of binding to FGF2 alone, cannot bind to a FGF2.heparin complex, thus preventing FGFR1.FGF2.heparin complex formation. By contrast, heparin-bound anosmin-1 binds to pre-formed FGF2.FGFR1 complex, generating an anosmin-1.FGFR1.FGF2.heparin complex. Furthermore, a functional interaction between anosmin-1 and the FGFR1 signaling complex is demonstrated by immunofluorescence co-localization and Transwell migration assays where anosmin-1 was shown to induce opposing effects during chemotaxis of human neuronal cells. Our study provides molecular and cellular evidence for a modulatory action of anosmin-1 on FGFR1 signaling, whereby binding of anosmin-1 to FGFR1 and heparin can play a dual role in assembly and activity of the ternary FGFR1.FGF2.heparin complex.",

The 14.8-billion bp DNA sequence was generated over 9 months from 27,271,853 high-quality sequence reads (5.11-fold coverage of the genome) from both ends of plasmid clones made from the DNA of five individuals. Two assembly strategies-a whole-genome assembly and a regional chromosome assembly-were used, each combining sequence data from Celera and the publicly funded genome effort. The public data were shredded into 550-bp segments to create a 2.9-fold coverage of those genome regions that had been sequenced, without including biases inherent in the cloning and assembly procedure used by the publicly funded group. This brought the effective coverage in the assemblies to eightfold, reducing the number and size of gaps in the final assembly over what would be obtained with 5.11-fold coverage. The two assembly strategies yielded very similar results that largely agree with independent mapping data. The assemblies effectively cover the euchromatic regions of the human chromosomes. More than 90% of the genome is in scaffold assemblies of 100,000 bp or more, and 25% of the genome is in scaffolds of 10 million bp or larger. Analysis of the genome sequence revealed 26,588 protein-encoding transcripts for which there was strong corroborating evidence and an additional approximately 12,000 computationally derived genes with mouse matches or other weak supporting evidence. Although gene-dense clusters are obvious, almost half the genes are dispersed in low G+C sequence separated by large tracts of apparently noncoding sequence. Only 1.1% of the genome is spanned by exons, whereas 24% is in introns, with 75% of the genome being intergenic DNA. Duplications of segmental blocks, ranging in size up to chromosomal lengths, are abundant throughout the genome and reveal a complex evolutionary history. Comparative genomic analysis indicates vertebrate expansions of genes associated with neuronal function, with tissue-specific developmental regulation, and with the hemostasis and immune systems. DNA sequence comparisons between the consensus sequence and publicly funded genome data provided locations of 2.1 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A random pair of human haploid genomes differed at a rate of 1 bp per 1250 on average, but there was marked heterogeneity in the level of polymorphism across the genome. Less than 1% of all SNPs resulted in variation in proteins, but the task of determining which SNPs have functional consequences remains an open challenge.",

Partial amino acid sequence data (300 residues) was obtained for PR65. Molecular cloning showed that two distinct mRNAs (termed alpha and beta) encoded the PR65 subunit.

However, the mechanism of shugoshin-dependent protection of cohesin is unknown. Here we find a specific subtype of serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) associating with human shugoshin. PP2A colocalizes with shugoshin at centromeres and is required for centromeric protection. Purified shugoshin complex has an ability to reverse the phosphorylation of cohesin in vitro, suggesting that dephosphorylation of cohesin is the mechanism of protection at centromeres. Meiotic shugoshin of fission yeast also associates with PP2A, with both proteins collaboratively protecting Rec8-containing cohesin at centromeres.

The subcellular distribution and mechanisms that regulate the localization of ErbB receptors are unknown. We have found that ErbB receptors are present in brain subcellular fractions enriched for postsynaptic densities (PSD). The ErbB-4 receptor is unique among the ErbB proteins because its C-terminal tail (T-V-V) conforms to a sequence that binds to a protein motif known as the PDZ domain. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we found that the C-terminal region of ErbB-4 interacts with the three related membrane-associated guanylate kinases (MAGUKs) PSD-95/SAP90, PSD-93/chapsyn-110, and SAP 102, which harbor three PDZ domains, as well as with beta(2)-syntrophin, which has a single PDZ domain. As with N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, ErbB4 interacts with the first two PDZ domains of PSD-95. Using coimmunoprecipitation assays, we confirmed the direct interactions between ErbB-4 and PSD-95 in transfected heterologous cells, as well as in vivo, where both proteins are coimmunoprecipitated from brain lysates. Moreover, evidence for colocalization of these proteins was also observed by immunofluorescence in cultured hippocampal neurons. ErbB-4 colocalizes with PSD-95 and NMDA receptors at a subset of excitatory synapses apposed to synaptophysin-positive presynaptic terminals. The capacity of ErbB receptors to interact with PDZ-domain proteins at cell junctions is conserved from invertebrates to mammals. As discussed, the interactions found between receptor tyrosine kinases and MAGUKs at neuronal synapses may have important implications for activity-dependent plasticity.",

When PC12 cells were differentiated into neuronal cells by nerve growth factor (NGF), a significant increase in the expression level of P-LAP in the cell was observed. As in the case of insulin treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes, treatment of PC12 cells with forskolin caused the translocation of the enzyme from intracellular vesicle to the cell surface plasma membrane.

Structural and mutagenic studies had already identified one of the residues delineating the steroid-binding cavity, A24, as the major molecular determinant for the stereospecificity of m17alpha-HSD. We report here a ternary complex crystal structure (m17alpha-HSD:NADP(+):epi-T) determined at 1.85 A resolution that confirms this and reveals a unique steroid-binding mode for an AKR enzyme. Indeed, in addition to the interactions found in all other AKRs (van der Waals contacts stabilizing the core of the steroid and the hydrogen bonds established at the catalytic site by the Y55 and H117 residues with the oxygen atom of the ketone group to be reduced), m17alpha-HSD establishes with the other extremity of the steroid nucleus an additional interaction involving K31. By combining direct mutagenesis and kinetic studies, we found that the elimination of this hydrogen bond did not affect the affinity of the enzyme for its steroid substrate but led to a slight but significant increase of its catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/K(m)), suggesting a role for K31 in the release of the steroidal product at the end of the reaction. This previously unobserved steroid-binding mode for an AKR is similar to that adopted by other steroid-binding proteins, the hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases of the short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDR) family and the steroid hormone nuclear receptors. Mutagenesis and structural studies made on the human type 3 3alpha-HSD, a closely related enzyme that shares 73% amino acids identity with the m17alpha-HSD, also revealed that the residue at position 24 of these two enzymes directly affects the binding and/or the release of NADPH, in addition to its role in their 17alpha/17beta stereospecificity.",

However, integrin alpha(v)beta(6) has been shown to be an efficient receptor for another RGD-containing picornavirus, foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV). In view of the similarity in sequence context of the RGD motifs in CAV9 and FMDV, we investigated whether alpha(v)beta(6) can also serve as a receptor for CAV9. We found that CAV9 can bind to purified alpha(v)beta(6) and also to SW480 cells transfected with beta(6) cDNA, allowing expression of alpha(v)beta(6) on their surface, but it cannot bind to mock-transfected cells. In addition, a higher yield of CAV9 was obtained in beta(6)-expressing cells than in mock-transfected cells. There was no similar enhancement in infection with an RGD-less CAV9 mutant. We also found beta(6) on the surface of GMK cells, a cell line which CAV9 infects efficiently by an RGD-dependent mechanism. Significantly, this infection is blocked by an antibody to alpha(v)beta(6), while this antibody did not block the low level of infection by the RGD-less mutant.

These observations define PMEPA1 as a novel androgen-regulated gene exhibiting abundant expression in prostate tissue. The increased expression of PMEPA1 in relapsed tumors of the CWR22 model suggests activation of androgen signaling in hormone refractory disease. PMEPA1, along with other highly androgen-induced prostate-specific genes, has potential to serve as an androgen signaling read-out biomarker in prostate tissue.",

We found three alternative exons encoding a portion of the third immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain of the receptor. One of these alternatives encodes a sequence that is part of a secreted form of FGFR 1. The other two encode sequences that are likely part of transmembrane forms of FGFR 1. One of these forms has not been previously reported in published cDNAs. Also, we have determined the structural organization of a portion of the human FGFR 2 gene (bek) and found a similar arrangement of alternative exons for the third Ig-like domain. The arrangement of these genes suggests that there are conserved mechanisms governing the expression of secreted FGF receptors as well as the expression of at least two distinct membrane-spanning forms of the FGF receptors. The diverse forms appear to be generated by alternative splicing of mRNA and selective use of polyadenylation signals.",

The PX domain directs SNXs to phosphatidylinositides containing membranes of the endosomal compartment, where the SNXs are involved in the sorting of transmembrane proteins. SNX17 is known to interact with P-selectin and the LDL receptor family. Here, we report that the PX domain of SNX17 specifically binds to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate-containing membranes. The functional part of SNX17 that binds P-selectin or Patched (PTCH) consists of a truncated FERM domain and a unique C terminus together (FC-unit). In a yeast two-hybrid analysis a putative recognition motif for the FC-unit was revealed within P-selectin as FxNaa(F/Y). When HepG2 cells overexpress P-selectin together with SNX17, SNX17 changes its distribution from early endosomes to lysobisphosphatidic acid-containing late endosomes. Furthermore, overexpressed SNX17 restrains P-selectin in the outer membrane of the late endosomal compartment, thus preventing the normal lysosomal accumulation of P-selectin. These results suggest that the PX domain is necessary for the intracellular localisation, while the FC-unit is required for cargo recognition. We hypothesise that the expression level of SNX17 may regulate the lysosomal degradation, at least for P-selectin, by suppressing its entry into the inner vesicles of the multi-vesicular bodies (MVBs).",

        "abstracttext": "The binding interactions for the three primary reactants of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) system, basic FGF (bFGF), an FGF receptor, FGFR1, and the cofactor heparin/heparan sulfate (HS), were explored by isothermal titrating calorimetry, ultracentrifugation, and molecular modeling. The binding reactions were first dissected into three binary reactions: (1) FGFR1 + bFGF<==>FGFR1/bFGF, K1 = 41 (+/- 12) nM; (2) FGFR1 + HS<==>FGFR1/HS, K2 = 104 (+/- 17) microM; and (3) bFGF + HS<==>bFGF/HS, K3 = 470 (+/- 20) nM, where HS = low MW heparin, approximately 3 kDa. The first, binding of bFGF to FGFR1 in the absence of HS, was found to be a simple binary binding reaction that is enthalpy dominated and characterized by a single equilibrium constant, K1. The conditional reactions of bFGF and FGFR1 in the presence of heparin were then examined under conditions that saturate only the bFGF heparin site (1.5 equiv of HS/bFGF) or saturate the HS binding sites of both bFGF and FGFR1 (1.0 mM HS). Both 3-and 5-kDa low MW heparins increased the affinity for FGFR1 binding to bFGF by approximately 10-fold (Kd = 4.9 +/- 2.0 nM), relative to the reaction with no HS. In addition, HS, at a minimum of 1.5 equiv/bFGF, induced a second FGFR1 molecule to bind to another lower affinity secondary site on bFGF (K4 = 1.9 +/- 0.7 microM) in an entropy-dominated reaction to yield a quaternary complex containing two FGFR1, one bFGF, and at least one HS. Molecular weight estimates by analytical ultracentrifugation of such fully bound complexes were consistent with this proposed composition. To understand these binding reactions in terms of structural components of FGFR1, a three-dimensional model of FGFR1 was constructed using segment match modeling. Electrostatic potential calculations confirmed that an elongated cluster, approximately 15 x 35 A, of nine cationic residues focused positive potential (+2kBT) to the solvent-exposed beta-sheet A, B, E, C' surface of the D(II) domain model, strongly implicating this locus as the HS binding region of FGFR1. Structural models for HS binding to FGFR1, and HS binding to bFGF, were built individually and then assembled to juxtapose adjacent binding sites for receptor and HS on bFGF, against matching proposed growth factor and HS binding sites on FGFR1. The calorimetric binding results and the molecular modeling exercises suggest that bFGF and HS participate in a concerted bridge mechanism for the dimerization of FGFR1 in vitro and presumably for mitogenic signal transduction in vivo.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

        "abstracttext": "Defective regulation of platelet activation/aggregation is a predominant cause for arterial thrombosis, the major complication of atherosclerosis triggering myocardial infarction and stroke. A central regulatory pathway conveying inhibition of platelet activation/aggregation is nitric oxide (NO)/cyclic GMP (cGMP) signaling by cGMP-dependent protein kinase I (cGKI). However, the regulatory cascade downstream of cGKI mediating platelet inhibition is still unclear. Here, we show that the inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor-associated cGMP kinase substrate (IRAG) is abundantly expressed in platelets and assembled in a macrocomplex together with cGKIbeta and the inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type I (InsP3RI). cGKI phosphorylates IRAG at Ser664 and Ser677 in intact platelets. Targeted deletion of the IRAG-InsP3RI interaction in IRAGDelta12/Delta12 mutant mice leads to a loss of NO/cGMP-dependent inhibition of fibrinogen-receptor activation and platelet aggregation. Intracellular calcium transients were not affected by DEA/NO or cGMP in mutant platelets. Furthermore, intravital microscopy shows that NO fails to prevent arterial thrombosis of the injured carotid artery in IRAGDelta12/Delta12 mutants. These findings reveal that interaction between IRAG and InsP3RI has a central role in NO/cGMP-dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation and in vivo thrombosis.",

In addition, aberrant ERalpha activity is linked to several pathological conditions including breast cancer. A complex network of coregulatory proteins is largely believed to determine the transcriptional activity of ERalpha. We report here the isolation of a protein, denoted RTA for repressor of tamoxifen transcriptional activity, which contains an RNA recognition motif and interacts with the receptor N-terminal activation domain. RTA interacts with RNA in vitro, and its overexpression inhibits the partial agonist activity manifest by the antiestrogen tamoxifen while minimally affecting E2-activated transcription. Mutation of the RNA recognition motif alters RNA binding specificity and results in a dominant negative form of RTA that leads to derepression of ERalpha transcriptional activity, allowing all classes of antiestrogens to manifest partial agonist activity and enhancing agonist efficacy. These findings suggest a role for RNA binding proteins as coregulatory factors of the nuclear receptor family and reveal a novel mechanism by which antiestrogens can manifest agonist activities in some tissues.",

Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and bacterial lipopolysaccharide induce a transient stimulation of arginine influx and efflux through system y(+). Increased expression of SLC7A2/CAT2B is detectable from 3 h of treatment, while SLC7A1 expression is inhibited at later times of incubation. System y(+)L activity and expression remain unaltered. Nitric oxide synthase type 2 mRNA is not detected in the absence or presence of TNF-alpha, while the latter condition lowers nitric oxide synthase type 3 expression at the mRNA and the protein level. Nitrite accumulation is comparable in cytokine-treated and control cells up to 48 h of treatment. It is concluded that modulation of endothelial arginine transport by TNF-alpha or lipopolysaccharide occurs exclusively through changes in CAT2B and CAT1 expression and is dissociated from stimulation of nitric oxide production.",

Progression through this cycle involves a large number of dedicated protein complexes and signaling pathways, and deregulation of this process is implicated in tumorigenesis. We applied high-resolution mass spectrometry-based proteomics to investigate the proteome and phosphoproteome of the human cell cycle on a global scale and quantified 6027 proteins and 20,443 unique phosphorylation sites and their dynamics. Co-regulated proteins and phosphorylation sites were grouped according to their cell cycle kinetics and compared to publicly available messenger RNA microarray data. Most detected phosphorylation sites and more than 20% of all quantified proteins showed substantial regulation, mainly in mitotic cells. Kinase-motif analysis revealed global activation during S phase of the DNA damage response network, which was mediated by phosphorylation by ATM or ATR or DNA-dependent protein kinases. We determined site-specific stoichiometry of more than 5000 sites and found that most of the up-regulated sites phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) or CDK2 were almost fully phosphorylated in mitotic cells. In particular, nuclear proteins and proteins involved in regulating metabolic processes have high phosphorylation site occupancy in mitosis. This suggests that these proteins may be inactivated by phosphorylation in mitotic cells.",

Its extracellular domain, like that of the signaling receptor Notch and of amyloid precursor protein (APP), is proteolytically processed at multiple positions. This similarity led us to investigate whether LRP, like APP and Notch, might also be cleaved at a third, intramembranous or cytoplasmic site, resulting in the release of its intracellular domain. Using independent experimental approaches we demonstrate that the cytoplasmic domain is released by a gamma-secretase-like activity and that this event is modulated by protein kinase C. Furthermore, cytoplasmic adaptor proteins that bind to the LRP tail affect the subcellular localization of the free intracellular domain and may regulate putative signaling functions. Finally, we show that the degradation of the free tail fragment is mediated by the proteasome. These findings suggest a novel role for the intracellular domain of LRP that may involve the subcellular translocation of preassembled signaling complexes from the plasma membrane.",

Immunofluorescent imaging indicates that WIPI49 is localized to both trans-Golgi and endosomal membranes, organelles between which it traffics in a microtubule-dependent manner. Live cell imaging establishes that WIPI49 traffics through the same set of endosomal membranes as that followed by the mannose-6-phosphate receptor (MPR), and consistent with this, WIPI49 is enriched in clathrin-coated vesicles. Ectopic expression of wild-type WIPI49 disrupts the proper functioning of this MPR pathway, whereas expression of a double point mutant (R221,222AWIPI49) unable to bind phosphoinositides does not disrupt this pathway. Finally, suppression of WIPI49 expression through RNAi, demonstrates that its presence is required for normal endosomal organization and distribution of the CI-MPR.

The predicted open reading frame encodes a protein of 1724 amino acids with a molecular mass of 192.8 kDa. The protein contains a region showing homology to the catalytic domains of the nuclear-localized ADP-ribosyltransferase proteins (Adprt), two recently identified Adprt-like proteins (Adprtl2 and Adprtl3), and the telomere-associated protein tankyrase. Key amino acids known to be important for the activity of these enzymes are conserved within this region of the Adprtl1 protein, indicating that Adprtl1 is a functional poly(ADP-ribosyl)transferase. As has been noted for tankyrase, sequence analysis of the Adprtl1 protein suggests that it is not capable of binding DNA directly. Thus, the transferase activity of Adprtl1 may be activated by other factors such as protein-protein interaction mediated by the extensive carboxyl terminus. We have subsequently refined the location of the ADPRTL1 genomic locus to 13q11, close to the recently cloned ZNF198 gene.",

Nine of the bundles contain vinculin-binding sites (VBS); R2R3 are atypical, with each containing two VBS. Talin R2R3 also binds synergistically to RIAM, a Rap1 effector involved in integrin activation. Biochemical and structural data show that vinculin and RIAM binding to R2R3 is mutually exclusive. Moreover, vinculin binding requires domain unfolding, whereas RIAM binds the folded R2R3 double domain. In cells, RIAM is enriched in nascent adhesions at the leading edge whereas vinculin is enriched in FAs. We propose a model in which RIAM binding to R2R3 initially recruits talin to membranes where it activates integrins.

We demonstrated that Klotho and betaKlotho, homologous single-pass transmembrane proteins that bind to FGFRs, are required for metabolic activity of FGF23 and FGF21, respectively. Here we show that, like FGF21, FGF19 also requires betaKlotho. Both FGF19 and FGF21 can signal through FGFR1-3 bound by betaKlotho and increase glucose uptake in adipocytes expressing FGFR1. Additionally, both FGF19 and FGF21 bind to the betaKlotho-FGFR4 complex; however, only FGF19 signals efficiently through FGFR4. Accordingly, FGF19, but not FGF21, activates FGF signaling in hepatocytes that primarily express FGFR4 and reduces transcription of CYP7A1 that encodes the rate-limiting enzyme for bile acid synthesis. We conclude that the expression of betaKlotho, in combination with particular FGFR isoforms, determines the tissue-specific metabolic activities of FGF19 and FGF21.",

        "abstracttext": "Previous studies have shown that leukemia related protein 16 (LRP16) is estrogenically regulated and that it can stimulate the proliferation of MCF-7 breast cancer cells, but there are no data on the mechanism of this pathway. Here, we demonstrate that the LRP16 expression is estrogen dependent in several epithelium-derived tumor cells. In addition, the suppression of the endogenous LRP16 in estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha)-positive MCF-7 cells not only inhibits cells growth, but also significantly attenuates the cell line's estrogen-responsive proliferation ability. However, ectopic expression of LRP16 in ERalpha-negative MDA-MB-231 cells has no effect on proliferation. These data suggest the involvement of LRP16 in estrogen signaling. We also provide novel evidence by both ectopic expression and small interfering RNA knockdown approaches that LRP16 enhances ERalpha-mediated transcription activity. In stably LRP16-inhibitory MCF-7 cells, the estrogen-induced upregulation of several well-known ERalpha target genes including cyclin D1 and c-myc is obviously impaired. Results from glutathione S-transferase pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation assays revealed that LRP16 physically interacts with ERalpha in a manner that is estrogen independent but is enhanced by estrogen. Furthermore, a mammalian two-hybrid assay indicated that the binding region of LRP16 localizes to the A/B activation function 1 domain of ERalpha. Taken together, these results present new data supporting a role for estrogenically regulated LRP16 as an ERalpha coactivator, providing a positive feedback regulatory loop for ERalpha signal transduction.",

Here, we show that human Nedd4 (Nedd4-1), an E3 ubiquitin ligase comprised of a C2 domain, 4 WW domains, and a Hect domain, regulates endocytosis and signalling of FGFR1. Nedd4-1 binds directly to and ubiquitylates activated FGFR1, by interacting primarily via its WW3 domain with a novel non-canonical sequence (non-PY motif) on FGFR1. Deletion of this recognition motif (FGFR1-\u03946) abolishes Nedd4-1 binding and receptor ubiquitylation, and impairs endocytosis of activated receptor, as also observed upon Nedd4-1 knockdown. Accordingly, FGFR1-\u03946, or Nedd4-1 knockdown, exhibits sustained FGF-dependent receptor Tyr phosphorylation and downstream signalling (activation of FRS2\u03b1, Akt, Erk1/2, and PLC\u03b3). Expression of FGFR1-\u03946 in human embryonic neural stem cells strongly promotes FGF2-dependent neuronal differentiation. Furthermore, expression of this FGFR1-\u03946 mutant in zebrafish embryos disrupts anterior neuronal patterning (head development), consistent with excessive FGFR1 signalling.

In addition, newly synthesized FGFR1 enters the nucleus in response to cellular stimulation and during development. Nuclear FGFR1 can transactivate CRE (cAMP responsive element), activate CRE-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP) and gene activities causing cellular growth and differentiation. Here, a yeast two-hybrid assay was performed to identify FGFR1-binding proteins and the mechanism of nuclear FGFR1 action. Ten FGFR1-binding proteins were identified. Among the proteins detected with the intracellular FGFR1 domain was a 90-kDa ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK1), a regulator of CREB, CBP, and histone phosphorylation. FGFR1 bound to the N-terminal region of RSK1. The FGFR1-RSK1 interaction was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and colocalization in the nucleus and cytoplasm of mammalian cells. Predominantly nuclear FGFR1-RSK1 interaction was observed in the rat brain during neurogenesis and in cAMP-stimulated cultured neural cells. In TE671 cells, transfected FGFR1 colocalized and coimmunoprecipitated, almost exclusively, with nuclear RSK1. Nuclear RSK1 kinase activity and RSK1 activation of CREB were enhanced by transfected FGFR1. In contrast, kinase-deleted FGFR1 (TK-), which did not bind to RSK1 failed to stimulate nuclear RSK1 activity or RSK1 activation of CREB. Kinase inactive FGFR1 (K514A) bound effectively to nuclear RSK1, but it failed to stimulate RSK1. Thus, active FGFR1 kinase regulates the functions of nuclear RSK1. The interaction of nuclear FGFR1 with pluripotent RSK1 offers a new mechanism through which FGFR1 may control fundamental cellular processes.",

However, here we demonstrate that ER is recruited to the NFkappaB response element of the MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) and IL-8 promoters and displaces CBP, but not p65, in the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. In contrast, ER displaced p65 and associated coregulators from the IL-6 promoter, demonstrating a gene-specific role for CBP in integrating inflammatory and steroid signaling. Further, RNA interference and overexpression studies demonstrated that CBP dosage regulates estrogen-mediated suppression of MCP-1 and IL-8, but not IL-6, gene expression.

In both cell types the bidirectional fluxes of arginine are due to the additive contributions of two Na(+)-independent, transstimulated transport systems. One of these mechanisms, inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) and sensitive to the membrane potential, is identifiable with system y(+). The NEM- and potential-insensitive component, suppressed by L-leucine only in the presence of Na(+), is mostly due to the activity of system y(+)L. The inward and outward activities of the two systems are comparable in control and LPI fibroblasts.

Nek6 (314AA) and Nek7 (303AA), 76% identical, have little noncatalytic sequence but bind to the carboxyl-terminal noncatalytic tail of Nercc1/Nek9, a NIMA family protein kinase that is activated in mitosis. Microinjection of anti-Nercc1 antibodies leads to spindle abnormalities and prometaphase arrest or chromosome missegregation. Herein we show that Nek6 is increased in abundance and activity during mitosis; activation requires the phosphorylation of Ser206 on the Nek6 activation loop. This phosphorylation and the activity of recombinant Nek6 is stimulated by coexpression with an activated mutant of Nercc1. Moreover, Nercc1 catalyzes the direct phosphorylation of prokaryotic recombinant Nek6 at Ser206 in vitro concomitant with 20-25-fold activation of Nek6 activity; Nercc1 activates Nek7 in vitro in a similar manner. Nercc1/Nek9 is likely to be responsible for the activation of Nek6 during mitosis and probably participates in the regulation of Nek7 as well.

Current studies are confined to ER-beta1, and the functional roles of isoforms 2, 4, and 5 remain unclear. Full-length ER-beta4 and -beta5 isoforms were obtained from a prostate cell line, and they exhibit differential expression in a wide variety of human tissues/cell lines. Through molecular modeling, we established that only ER-beta1 has a full-length helix 11 and a helix 12 that assumes an agonist-directed position. In ER-beta2, the shortened C terminus results in a disoriented helix 12 and marked shrinkage in the coactivator binding cleft. ER-beta4 and -beta5 completely lack helix 12. We further demonstrated that ER-beta1 is the only fully functional isoform, whereas ER-beta2, -beta4, and -beta5 do not form homodimers and have no innate activities of their own. However, the isoforms can heterodimerize with ER-beta1 and enhance its transactivation in a ligand-dependent manner. ER-beta1 tends to form heterodimers with other isoforms under the stimulation of estrogens but not phytoestrogens. Collectively, these data support the premise that (i) ER-beta1 is the obligatory partner of an ER-beta dimer, whereas the other isoforms function as variable dimer partners with enhancer activity, and (ii) a single functional helix 12 in a dimer is sufficient for gene transactivation. Thus, ER-beta behaves like a noncanonical type-I receptor, and its action may depend on differential amounts of ER-beta1 homo- and heterodimers formed upon stimulation by a specific ligand.

The comparison of extended orthologous chromosomal regions should also reveal other characteristic traits essential for chromosome or gene function. In the present study we have sequenced and compared a region of conserved synteny from human chromosome 11p15.3 and mouse chromosome 7. In human, this region is known to contain several genes involved in the development of various disorders like Beckwith-Wiedemann overgrowth syndrome and other tumor diseases. Furthermore, in the neighboring chromosome region 11p15.5 extensive imprinting of genes has been reported which might extend to region 11p15.3. The analysis of approximately 730 kb in human and 620 kb in mouse led to the identification of eleven genes. All putative genes found in the mouse DNA were also present in the same order and orientation in the human chromosome. However, in the human DNA one putative gene of unknown function could be identified which is not present in the orthologous position of the mouse chromosome. The sequence similarity between human and mouse is higher in transcribed and exon regions than in non-transcribed segments. Dot plot analysis, however, reveals a surprisingly well-conserved sequence similarity over the entire analyzed region. In particular, the positions of CpG islands, short regions of very high GC content in the 5' region of putative genes, are similar in human and mouse. With respect to base composition, two distinct segments of significantly different GC content exist as well in human as in the mouse. With a GC content of 45% the one segment would correspond to \"isochore H1\" and the other segment (39% GC in human, 40% GC in mouse) to \"isochore L1/L2\". The gene density (one gene per 66 kb) is slightly higher than the average calculated for the complete human genome (one gene per 90 kb). The comparison of the number and distribution of repetitive elements shows that the proportion of human DNA made up by interspersed repeats (43.8%) is significantly higher than in the corresponding mouse DNA (30.1%). This partly explains why the human DNA is longer between the landmark genes used to define the orthologous positions in human and mouse.",

We show that the surf-4 coding sequence is conserved between mouse and human. Primary sequence analysis predicts that the mouse surf-4 protein contains seven transmembrane domains and a double lysine endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retrieval motif on the carboxyl terminus. Translation of the mouse surf-4 cDNA in vitro resulted in the production of a 30 kDa membrane protein. Salt and detergent extraction procedures showed that the surf-4 protein associated tightly with the microsomal membranes. Proteolysis protection of 14 and 3 kDa fragments indicates that the surf-4 protein contains at least two membrane spanning domains: this is consistent with the proposed topology. Addition of the c-Myc epitope into three different regions of the surf-4 protein resulted in transfectants that expressed a myc-tagged protein. Immunofluorescence analysis of the three surf-4 myc chimeras yielded a cytoplasmic staining pattern. Consistent with the presence of the ER retrieval motif, the surf-4 myc protein was not detected at the plasma membrane. A model for the proposed structure of the surf-4 protein is presented.",

Using stable isotope labeling along with a two-step strategy for phosphopeptide enrichment and high mass accuracy mass spectrometry, we examined protein phosphorylation in a human cell line arrested in the G(1) and mitotic phases of the cell cycle. We report the identification of >14,000 different phosphorylation events, more than half of which, to our knowledge, have not been described in the literature, along with relative quantitative data for the majority of these sites. We observed >1,000 proteins with increased phosphorylation in mitosis including many known cell cycle regulators.

In HEC1A cells transiently transfected with pVEGF1 and a series of deletion plasmids, it was shown that E2-dependent down-regulation was dependent on wild-type estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) and reversed by the anti-estrogen ICI 182, 780, and this response was not affected by progestins. Deletion analysis of the VEGF gene promoter identified an overlapping G/GC-rich site between -66 to -47 that was required for decreased transactivation by E2. Protein-DNA binding studies using electrophoretic mobility shift and DNA footprinting assays showed that both Sp1 and Sp3 proteins bound this region of the VEGF promoter. Coimmunoprecipitation and pull-down assays demonstrated that Sp3 and ERalpha proteins physically interact, and the interacting domains of both proteins are different from those previously observed for interactions between Sp1 and ERalpha proteins. Using a dominant negative form of Sp3 and transcriptional activation assays in Schneider SL-2 insect cells, it was confirmed that ERalpha-Sp3 interactions define a pathway for E2-mediated inhibition of gene expression, and this represents a new mechanism for decreased gene expression by E2.",

Unlike other growth factors, FGFs act in concert with heparin or heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) to activate FGFRs and to induce the pleiotropic responses that lead to the variety of cellular responses induced by this large family of growth factors. A variety of human skeletal dysplasias have been linked to specific point mutations in FGFR1, FGFR2 and FGFR3 leading to severe impairment in cranial, digital and skeletal development. Gain of function mutations in FGFRs were also identified in a variety of human cancers such as myeloproliferative syndromes, lymphomas, prostate and breast cancers as well as other malignant diseases. The binding of FGF and HSPG to the extracellular ligand domain of FGFR induces receptor dimerization, activation and autophosphorylation of multiple tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor molecule. A variety of signaling proteins are phosphorylated in response to FGF stimulation including Shc, phospholipase-Cgamma, STAT1, Gab1 and FRS2alpha leading to stimulation of intracellular signaling pathways that control cell proliferation, cell differentiation, cell migration, cell survival and cell shape.

Pathohistological analysis of these mice indeed showed abnormal development of the peripheral olfactory system and defective embryonic migration of the neuroendocrine GnRH cells to the basal forebrain, which results in increased mortality of newborn mice and reduced fertility in adults. We thus screened 386 KS patients for the presence of mutations in SEMA3A (by Sanger sequencing of all 17 coding exons and flanking splice sites) and identified nonsynonymous mutations in 24 patients, specifically, a frameshifting small deletion (D538fsX31) and seven different missense mutations (R66W, N153S, I400V, V435I, T688A, R730Q, R733H). All the mutations were found in heterozygous state. Seven mutations resulted in impaired secretion of semaphorin-3A by transfected COS-7 cells (D538fsX31, R66W, V435I) or reduced signaling activity of the secreted protein in the GN11 cell line derived from embryonic GnRH cells (N153S, I400V, T688A, R733H), which strongly suggests that these mutations have a pathogenic effect. Notably, mutations in other KS genes had already been identified, in heterozygous state, in five of these patients.

The light chain contains the transport pore, while the heavy chain appears to be necessary for trafficking the light chain to the plasma membrane. In this study, the role of the 4F2hc heavy chain in the function of the y+ LAT2 light chain was investigated. Carboxy terminal truncations and site specific mutants of 4F2hc were co-expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes with the y+ LAT2 light chain, and the oocytes were analysed for transport activity and surface expression. Truncations of the 4F2hc carboxy terminus ranging between 15 and 404 residues caused a complete loss of light chain function, although all heterodimers were expressed at the cell surface. This indicated that the 15 carboxy-terminal residues of 4F2hc are required for the transport function of the heterodimer. Mutation of the conserved residue leucine 523 to glutamine in the carboxy terminus reduced the Vmax of arginine and leucine uptake. The affinity of the transporter for both arginine and leucine remained unaltered, but the Km-value of Na+, being cotransported with leucine, increased about three-fold. The change of the Na+ Km caused a specific defect of leucine efflux, whereas uptake of leucine at high extracellular NaCl concentration was unaffected.",

        "abstracttext": "Notch receptors and their ligands play important roles in both normal animal development and pathogenesis. We show here that the F-box/WD40 repeat protein SEL-10 negatively regulates Notch receptor activity by targeting the intracellular domain of Notch receptors for ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. Blocking of endogenous SEL-10 activity was done by expression of a dominant-negative form containing only the WD40 repeats. In the case of Notch1, this block leads to an increase in Notch signaling stimulated by either an activated form of the Notch1 receptor or Jagged1-induced signaling through Notch1. Expression of dominant-negative SEL-10 leads to stabilization of the intracellular domain of Notch1. The Notch4 intracellular domain bound to SEL-10, but its activity was not increased as a result of dominant-negative SEL-10 expression. SEL-10 bound Notch4 via the WD40 repeats and bound preferentially to a phosphorylated form of Notch4 in cells. We mapped the region of Notch4 essential for SEL-10 binding to the C-terminal region downstream of the ankyrin repeats. When this C-terminal fragment of Notch4 was expressed in cells, it was highly labile but could be stabilized by the expression of dominant-negative SEL-10. Ubiquitination of Notch1 and Notch4 intracellular domains in vitro was dependent on SEL-10. Although SEL-10 interacts with the intracellular domains of both Notch1 and Notch4, these proteins respond differently to interference with SEL-10 function. Thus, SEL-10 functions to promote the ubiquitination of Notch proteins; however, the fates of these proteins may differ.",

        "abstracttext": "Comparison of the amino acid sequences of five eukaryotic UDPglucose pyrophosphorylases has identified a number of conserved residues that may be important for substrate binding or catalysis. Using the cloned cDNA for the human liver enzyme, we have investigated the role of several of these residues by site-directed mutagenesis. Changing the single conserved cysteine (residue 123) to serine resulted in an active enzyme, as did mutating the single concerned histidine (residue 266) to arginine. The two conserved tryptophans were each altered to serine; W218S is active while W333S is not. In the latter case, the enzyme does not appear to fold correctly, and a similar result was obtained by mutation to lysine at one (residue 391) of the four conserved arginines. The other three arginines are not essential, as judged by the observation that R389H, R422Q and R445H are all active. The kinetic properties of each active mutant were investigated and in most cases were found to be similar to those of wild-type. The most dramatic change is a sevenfold increase in the Km for magnesium pyrophosphate with C123S. Overall, none of these conserved residues appears to be essential for activity, although such a role cannot be ruled out for W333 and R391 where mutation resulted in defective folding.",

        "abstracttext": "Autophagy is a eukaryotic lysosomal bulk degradation system initiated by cytosolic cargo sequestration in autophagosomes. The Ser/Thr kinase mTOR has been shown to constitute a central role in controlling the initiation of autophagy by integrating multiple nutrient-dependent signaling pathways that crucially involves the activity of PI3K class III to generate the phosphoinositide PI(3)P. Recent reports demonstrate that the increase in cytosolic Ca(2+) can induce autophagy by inhibition of mTOR via the CaMKK-alpha/beta-mediated activation of AMPK. Here we demonstrate that Ca(2+) signaling can additionally induce autophagy independently of the Ca(2+)-mediated activation of AMPK. First, by LC3-II protein monitoring in the absence or presence of lysosomal inhibitors we confirm that the elevation of cytosolic Ca(2+) induces autophagosome generation and does not merely block autophagosome degradation. Further, we demonstrate that Ca(2+)-chelation strongly inhibits autophagy in human, mouse and chicken cells. Strikingly, we found that the PI(3)P-binding protein WIPI-1 (Atg18) responds to the increase of cytosolic Ca(2+) by localizing to autophagosomal membranes (WIPI-1 puncta) and that Ca(2+)-chelation inhibits WIPI-1 puncta formation, although PI(3)P-generation is not generally affected by these Ca(2+) flux modifications. Importantly, using AMPK-alpha1(-/-)alpha2(-/-) MEFs we show that thapsigargin application triggers autophagy in the absence of AMPK and does not involve complete mTOR inhibition, as detected by p70S6K phosphorylation. In addition, STO-609-mediated CaMKK-alpha/beta inhibition decreased the level of thapsigargin-induced autophagy only in AMPK-positive cells. We suggest that apart from reported AMPK-dependent regulation of autophagic degradation, an AMPK-independent pathway triggers Ca(2+)-mediated autophagy, involving the PI(3)P-effector protein WIPI-1 and LC3.",

Upon nutrient deprivation, labile microtubules specifically recruit markers of autophagosome formation like class III-phosphatidylinositol kinase, WIPI-1, the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate, and LC3-I, whereas mature autophagosomes may bind to stable microtubules. We further found that upon nutrient deprivation, tubulin acetylation increases both in labile and stable microtubules and is required to allow autophagy stimulation. Tubulin hyperacetylation on lysine 40 enhances kinesin-1 and JIP-1 recruitment on microtubules and allows JNK phosphorylation and activation. JNK, in turn, triggers the release of Beclin 1 from Bcl-2-Beclin 1 complexes and its recruitment on microtubules where it may initiate autophagosome formation. Finally, although kinesin-1 functions to carry autophagosomes in basal conditions, it is not involved in motoring autophagosomes after nutrient deprivation.

Herein we show that Nek6 is constitutively associated with Eg5 (also known as Kinesin-5 and Kif11), a kinesin that is necessary for spindle bipolarity. Nek6 phosphorylated Eg5 at several sites in vitro and one of these sites, Ser1033, is phosphorylated in vivo during mitosis. Whereas CDK1 phosphorylates nearly all Eg5 at Thr926 during mitosis, Nek6 phosphorylates approximately 3% of Eg5, primarily at the spindle poles. Eg5 depletion caused mitotic arrest, resulting in cells with a monopolar spindle. This arrest could be rescued by wild-type Eg5 but not by Eg5[Thr926Ala]. Despite substantial overexpression, Eg5[Ser1033Ala] rescued 50% of cells compared with wild-type Eg5, whereas an Eg5[Ser1033Asp] mutant was nearly as effective as wild type.

        "abstracttext": "The action of nuclear hormone receptors is tripartite, involving the receptor, its ligands, and its coregulator proteins. The estrogen receptor (ER), a member of this superfamily, is a hormone-activated transcription factor that mediates the stimulatory effects of estrogens and the inhibitory effects of antiestrogens such as tamoxifen in breast cancer and other estrogen target cells. To understand how antiestrogens and dominant negative ERs suppress ER activity, we used a dominant negative ER as bait in two-hybrid screening assays from which we isolated a clone from breast cancer cells that potentiates the inhibitory activities of dominant negative ERs and antiestrogen-liganded ER. At higher concentrations, it also represses the transcriptional activity of the estradiol-liganded ER, while having no effect on other nuclear hormone receptors. This clone, denoted REA for \"repressor of estrogen receptor activity,\" encodes a 37-kDa protein that is an ER-selective coregulator. Its competitive reversal of steroid receptor coactivator 1 enhancement of ER activity and its direct interaction with liganded ER suggest that it may play an important role in determining the sensitivity of estrogen target cells, including breast cancer cells, to antiestrogens and estrogens.",

        "abstracttext": "The low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) interacts with more than 30 ligands of different sizes and structures that can all be replaced by the receptor-associated protein (RAP). The double module of complement type repeats, CR56, of LRP binds many ligands including all three domains of RAP and alpha2-macroglobulin, which promotes the catabolism of the Abeta-peptide implicated in Alzheimer's disease. To understand the receptor-ligand cross-talk, the NMR structure of CR56 has been solved and ligand binding experiments with RAP domain 1 (RAPd1) have been performed. From chemical shift perturbations of both binding partners upon complex formation, a HADDOCK model of the complex between CR56 and RAPd1 has been obtained. The binding residues are similar to a common binding motif suggested from alpha2-macroglobulin binding studies and provide evidence for an understanding of their mutual cross-competition pattern. The present structural results convey a simultaneous description of both binding partners of an LRP-ligand complex and open a route to a broader understanding of the binding specificity of the LRP receptor, which may involve a general four-residue receptor-ligand recognition motif common to all LRP ligands. The present result may be beneficial in the design of antagonists of ligand binding to the LDL receptor family, and especially of drugs for treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",

Here, we provide evidence that gossypol induces autophagy followed by apoptotic cell death in both the MCF-7 human breast adenocarcinoma and HeLa cell lines. We first show that knockdown of the Bcl-2 homology domain 3-only protein Beclin 1 reduces gossypol-induced autophagy in MCF-7 cells, but not in HeLa cells. Gossypol inhibits the interaction between Beclin 1 and Bcl-2 (B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2), antagonizes the inhibition of autophagy by Bcl-2, and hence stimulates autophagy. We then show that knockdown of Vps34 reduces gossypol-induced autophagy in both cell lines, and consistent with this, the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate-binding protein WIPI-1 is recruited to autophagosomal membranes. Further, Atg5 knockdown also reduces gossypol-mediated autophagy. We conclude that gossypol induces autophagy in both a canonical and a noncanonical manner. Notably, we found that gossypol-mediated apoptotic cell death was potentiated by treatment with the autophagy inhibitor wortmannin or with small interfering RNA against essential autophagy genes (Vps34, Beclin 1, and Atg5). Our findings support the notion that gossypol-induced autophagy is cytoprotective and not part of the cell death process induced by this compound.",

In the first of several approaches, a biological signal sequence trap in yeast cells was utilized to identify cDNA clones encoding putative secreted proteins. A second strategy utilized various algorithms that recognize features such as the hydrophobic properties of signal sequences to identify putative proteins encoded by expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from human cDNA libraries. A third approach surveyed ESTs for protein sequence similarity to a set of known receptors and their ligands with the BLAST algorithm. Finally, both signal-sequence prediction algorithms and BLAST were used to identify single exons of potential genes from within human genomic sequence. The isolation of full-length cDNA clones for each of these candidate genes resulted in the identification of >1000 novel proteins. A total of 256 of these cDNAs are still novel, including variants and novel genes, per the most recent GenBank release version. The success of this large-scale effort was assessed by a bioinformatics analysis of the proteins through predictions of protein domains, subcellular localizations, and possible functional roles. The SPDI collection should facilitate efforts to better understand intercellular communication, may lead to new understandings of human diseases, and provides potential opportunities for the development of therapeutics.",

We previously identified DMRT1, a human gene with sequence similarity to genes that regulate the sexual development of nematodes and insects. These genes contain a novel DNA-binding domain, which we named the DM domain. DMRT1 maps to 9p24. 3 and in adults is expressed specifically in the testis. We have investigated the possible role of DM domain genes in 9p sex reversal. We identified a second DM domain gene, DMRT2, which also maps to 9p24.3. We found that point mutations in the coding region of DMRT1 and the DM domain of DMRT2 are not frequent in XY females. We showed by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis that both genes are deleted in the smallest reported sex-reversing 9p deletion, suggesting that gonadal dysgenesis in 9p-deleted individuals might be due to combined hemizygosity of DMRT1 and DMRT2.",

        "abstracttext": "Cycling proteins play important roles in the organization and function of the early secretory pathway by participating in membrane traffic and selective transport of cargo between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the intermediate compartment (ERGIC), and the Golgi. To identify new cycling proteins, we have developed a novel procedure for the purification of ERGIC membranes from HepG2 cells treated with brefeldin A, a drug known to accumulate cycling proteins in the ERGIC. Membranes enriched 110-fold over the homogenate for ERGIC-53 were obtained and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Major proteins corresponded to established and putative cargo receptors and components mediating protein maturation and membrane traffic. Among the uncharacterized proteins, a 32-kDa protein termed ERGIC-32 is a novel cycling membrane protein with sequence homology to Erv41p and Erv46p, two proteins enriched in COPII vesicles of yeast. ERGIC-32 localizes to the ERGIC and partially colocalizes with the human homologs of Erv41p and Erv46p, which mainly localize to the cis-Golgi. ERGIC-32 interacts with human Erv46 (hErv46) as revealed by covalent cross-linking and mistargeting experiments, and silencing of ERGIC-32 by small interfering RNAs increases the turnover of hErv46. We propose that ERGIC-32 functions as a modulator of the hErv41-hErv46 complex by stabilizing hErv46. Our novel approach for the isolation of the ERGIC from BFA-treated cells may ultimately lead to the identification of all proteins rapidly cycling early in the secretory pathway.",

        "abstracttext": "PINCH is a widely expressed and evolutionarily conserved protein comprising primarily five LIM domains, which are cysteine-rich consensus sequences implicated in mediating protein-protein interactions. We report here that PINCH is a binding protein for integrin-linked kinase (ILK), an intracellular serine/threonine protein kinase that plays important roles in the cell adhesion, growth factor, and Wnt signaling pathways. The interaction between ILK and PINCH has been consistently observed under a variety of experimental conditions. They have interacted in yeast two-hybrid assays, in solution, and in solid-phase-based binding assays. Furthermore, ILK, but not vinculin or focal adhesion kinase, has been coisolated with PINCH from mammalian cells by immunoaffinity chromatography, indicating that PINCH and ILK associate with each other in vivo. The PINCH-ILK interaction is mediated by the N-terminal-most LIM domain (LIM1, residues 1 to 70) of PINCH and multiple ankyrin (ANK) repeats located within the N-terminal domain (residues 1 to 163) of ILK. Additionally, biochemical studies indicate that ILK, through the interaction with PINCH, is capable of forming a ternary complex with Nck-2, an SH2/SH3-containing adapter protein implicated in growth factor receptor kinase and small GTPase signaling pathways. Finally, we have found that PINCH is concentrated in peripheral ruffles of cells spreading on fibronectin and have detected clusters of PINCH that are colocalized with the alpha5beta1 integrins. These results demonstrate a specific protein recognition mechanism utilizing a specific LIM domain and multiple ANK repeats and suggest that PINCH functions as an adapter protein connecting ILK and the integrins with components of growth factor receptor kinase and small GTPase signaling pathways.",

The ligand-dependent activation function AF-2 of the ER is located in the ligand binding domain (LBD), while the N-terminal A/B domain (AF-1) functions in a ligand-independent manner when isolated from the LBD. AF-1 and AF-2 exhibit cell type and promoter context specificity. Furthermore, the AF-1 activity of the human ERalpha (hERalpha) is enhanced through phosphorylation of the Ser(118) residue by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). From MCF-7 cells, we purified and cloned a 68-kDa protein (p68) which interacted with the A/B domain but not with the LBD of hERalpha. Phosphorylation of hERalpha Ser(118) potentiated the interaction with p68. We demonstrate that p68 enhanced the activity of AF-1 but not AF-2 and the estrogen-induced as well as the anti-estrogen-induced transcriptional activity of the full-length ERalpha in a cell-type-specific manner. However, it did not potentiate AF-1 or AF-2 of ERbeta, androgen receptor, retinoic acid receptor alpha, or mineralocorticoid receptor. We also show that the RNA helicase activity previously ascribed to p68 is dispensable for the ERalpha AF-1 coactivator activity and that p68 binds to CBP in vitro. Furthermore, the interaction region for p68 in the ERalpha A/B domain was essential for the full activity of hERalpha AF-1. Taken together, these findings show that p68 acts as a coactivator specific for the ERalpha AF-1 and strongly suggest that the interaction between p68 and the hERalpha A/B domain is regulated by MAPK-induced phosphorylation of Ser(118).",

Recombinant ARP2 expressed in COS cells is secreted and glycosylated. In human adult tissues, ARP2 mRNA is most abundant in heart, small intestine, spleen, and stomach. In rat embryos, ARP2 mRNA is most abundant in the blood vessels and skeletal muscles. Endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells also contain ARP2 mRNA.

A similar high molecular weight glycoprotein has been identified as a potential receptor for Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE). We demonstrate that the alpha 2 MR/LRP and the PE-binding glycoprotein have a similar mobility upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and are immunologically indistinguishable. Furthermore, affinity-purified alpha 2 MR/LRP binds specifically to PE but not to a mutant toxin defective in its ability to bind cells. The 39-kDa receptor-associated protein, which blocks binding of ligands to alpha 2 MR/LRP, also prevents binding and subsequent toxicity of PE for mouse fibroblasts. The concentration of receptor-associated protein that was required to reduce binding and toxicity to 50% was approximately 14 nM, a value virtually identical to the KD measured for the interaction of receptor-associated protein with the purified receptor.

Here, we applied automated high-throughput WIPI-1 puncta analysis, paralleled with LC3 lipidation assays, to investigate Ca(2+)-mediated autophagy modulation. We imposed cellular stress by starvation or administration of etoposide (0.5-50 \u03bcM), sorafenib (1-40 \u03bcM), staurosporine (20-500 nM), or thapsigargin (20-500 nM) (1, 2, or 3 h) and measured the formation of WIPI-1 positive autophagosomal membranes. Automated analysis of up to 5000 individual cells/treatment demonstrated that Ca(2+) chelation by BAPTA-AM (10 and 30 \u03bcM) counteracted starvation or pharmacological compound-induced WIPI-1 puncta formation and LC3 lipidation.

By small interefering RNA (siRNA)-mediated down-regulation of CaMKI or CaMKIV, we demonstrate that CaMKI contributes to stimulation of WIPI-1. In line, WIPI-1 positive autophagosomal membranes were formed in AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) \u03b1(1)/\u03b1(2)-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts upon nutrient starvation, whereas basal autophagy was prominently reduced. However, transient down-regulation of AMPK by siRNA resulted in an increased basal level of both WIPI-1 puncta and LC3 lipidation, and nutrient-starvation induced autophagy was sensitive to STO-609/KN-93.

        "abstracttext": "The two most consistent features of the diseases caused by trinucleotide repeat expansion-neuropsychiatric symptoms and the phenomenon of genetic anticipation-may be present in forms of dementia, hereditary ataxia, Parkinsonism, bipolar affective disorder, schizophrenia and autism. To identify candidate genes for these disorders, we have screened human brain cDNA libraries for the presence of gene fragments containing polymorphic trinucleotide repeats. Here we report the cDNA cloning of CAGR1, originally detected in a retinal cDNA library. The 2743 bp cDNA contains a 1077 bp open reading frame encoding 359 amino acids. This amino acid sequence is homologous (56% amino acid identify and 81% amino acid conservation) to the Caenorhabditis elegans cell fate-determining protein mab-21. CAGR1 is expressed in several human tissues, most prominently in the cerebellum, as a message of approximately 3.0 kb. The gene was mapped to 13q13, just telomeric to D13S220. A 5'-untranslated CAG trinucleotide repeat is highly polymorphic, with repeat length ranging from six to 31 triplets and a heterozygosity of 87-88% in 684 chromosomes from several human populations. One allele from an individual with an atypical movement disorder and bipolar affective disorder type II contains 46 triplets, 15 triplets longer than any other allele detected. Though insufficient data are available to link the long repeat to this clinical phenotype, an expansion mutation of the CAGR1 repeat can be considered a candidate for the etiology of disorders with anticipation or developmental abnormalities, and particularly any such disorders linked to chromosome 13.",

        "abstracttext": "The Rho family of GTPases plays key roles in the regulation of cell motility and morphogenesis. They also regulate protein kinase cascades, gene expression, and cell cycle progression. This multiplicity of roles requires that the Rho GTPases interact with a wide variety of downstream effector proteins. An understanding of their functions at a molecular level therefore requires the identification of the entire set of such effectors. Towards this end, we performed a two-hybrid screen using the TC10 GTPase as bait and identified a family of putative effector proteins related to MSE55, a murine stromal and epithelial cell protein of 55 kDa. We have named this family the Borg (binder of Rho GTPases) proteins. Complete open reading frames have been obtained for Borg1 through Borg3. We renamed MSE55 as Borg5. Borg1, Borg2, Borg4, and Borg5 bind both TC10 and Cdc42 in a GTP-dependent manner. Surprisingly, Borg3 bound only to Cdc42. An intact CRIB (Cdc42, Rac interactive binding) domain was required for binding. No interaction of the Borgs with Rac1 or RhoA was detectable. Three-hemagglutinin epitope (HA(3))-tagged Borg3 protein was mostly cytosolic when expressed ectopically in NIH 3T3 cells, with some accumulation in membrane ruffles. The phenotype induced by Borg3 was reminiscent of that caused by an inhibition of Rho function and was reversed by overexpression of Rho. Surprisingly, it was independent of the ability to bind Cdc42. Borg3 also inhibited Jun kinase activity by a mechanism that was independent of Cdc42 binding. HA(3)-Borg3 expression caused substantial delays in the spreading of cells on fibronectin surfaces after replating, and the spread cells lacked stress fibers. We propose that the Borg proteins function as negative regulators of Rho GTPase signaling.",

Its effects on muscle glycogen metabolism are unknown. We show that G(L) mRNA levels in primary cultured human myotubes are similar to those in freshly excised muscle, unlike subunits G(M) (gene PPP1R3A) or PTG (protein targeting to glycogen; gene PPP1R3C), which decrease strikingly. In cultured myotubes, expression of the genes coding for G(L), G(M) and PTG is not regulated by glucose or insulin. Overexpression of G(L) activates myotube GS (glycogen synthase), glycogenesis in glucose-replete and -depleted cells and glycogen accumulation. Compared with overexpressed G(M), G(L) has a more potent activating effect on glycogenesis, while marked enhancement of their combined action is only observed in glucose-replete cells. G(L) does not affect GP (glycogen phosphorylase) activity, while co-overexpression with muscle GP impairs G(L) activation of GS in glucose-replete cells. G(L) enhances long-term glycogenesis additively to glucose depletion and insulin, although G(L) does not change the phosphorylation of GSK3 (GS kinase 3) on Ser9 or its upstream regulator kinase Akt/protein kinase B on Ser473, nor its response to insulin. In conclusion, in cultured human myotubes, the G(L) gene is expressed as in muscle tissue and is unresponsive to glucose or insulin, as are G(M) and PTG genes. G(L) activates GS regardless of glucose, does not regulate GP and stimulates glycogenesis in combination with insulin and glucose depletion.",

Heparin also interacts with FGFR in the adjoining 1:1 FGF:FGFR complex to promote FGFR dimerization. The 6-O-sulfate group of heparin plays a pivotal role in mediating both interactions. The unexpected stoichiometry of heparin binding in the structure led us to propose a revised model for FGFR dimerization. Biochemical data in support of this model are also presented. This model provides a structural basis for FGFR activation by small molecule heparin analogs and may facilitate the design of heparin mimetics capable of modulating FGF signaling.",

The mechanisms regulating autophagosome formation and size remain unclear. Here, we show that autophagosome formation was triggered by the overexpression of a dominant-negative inactive mutant of Myotubularin-related phosphatase 3 (MTMR3). Mutant MTMR3 partially localized to autophagosomes, and PtdIns3P and two autophagy-related PtdIns3P-binding proteins, GFP-DFCP1 and GFP-WIPI-1alpha (WIPI49/Atg18), accumulated at sites of autophagosome formation. Knock-down of MTMR3 increased autophagosome formation, and overexpression of wild-type MTMR3 led to significantly smaller nascent autophagosomes and a net reduction in autophagic activity. These results indicate that autophagy initiation depends on the balance between PI 3-kinase and PI 3-phosphatase activity. Local levels of PtdIns3P at the site of autophagosome formation determine autophagy initiation and the size of the autophagosome membrane structure.",

In addition, and unexpectedly, we show that purified ACTR is a potent histone acetyltransferase and appears to define a distinct evolutionary branch to this recently described family. Thus, hormonal activation by nuclear receptors involves the mutual recruitment of at least three classes of histone acetyltransferases that may act cooperatively as an enzymatic unit to reverse the effects of histone deacetylase shown to be part of the nuclear receptor corepressor complex.",

Analysis of the sequencing gels revealed only two nucleotide changes that altered the structure of the protein.

The other was a substitution of arginine for an obligatory glycine at amino acid position 136.

        "abstracttext": "Endocytosis and targeting of growth factor receptors for lysosomal degradation have been associated with ubiquitination of the intracellular part of the receptors. To elucidate the role of receptor ubiquitination in internalization and sorting of fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), we constructed several mutants of FGFR1 in which lysines, potential ubiquitination sites, were substituted for arginines. Substitution of all lysine residues in the intracellular part of FGFR1 resulted in inactivation of the tyrosine kinase domain of the receptor. However, several multilysine FGFR1 mutants, where up to 26 of 29 lysines in the intracellular part of the receptor were mutated, retained tyrosine kinase activity. The active multilysine mutants were poorly ubiquitinated, but internalized normally, indicating that ubiquitination of the receptor is not required for endocytosis. In contrast, degradation of the multilysine mutants was dramatically reduced as the mutants were inefficiently transported to lysosomes but rather sorted to recycling endosomes. The altered sorting resulted in sustained signaling. The duration of FGFR1 signaling seems to be tightly regulated by receptor ubiquitination and subsequent sorting to the lysosomes for degradation.",

        "abstracttext": "Dyslexia, or specific reading disability, is the unexpected failure in learning to read and write when intelligence and senses are normal. One of the susceptibility genes, DYX1C1, has been implicated in neuronal migration, but little is known about its interactions and functions. As DYX1C1 was suggested to interact with the U-box protein CHIP (carboxy terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein), which also participates in the degradation of estrogen receptors alpha (ERalpha) and beta (ERbeta), we hypothesized that the effects of DYX1C1 might be at least in part mediated through the regulation of ERs. ERs have shown to be important in brain development and cognitive functions. Indeed, we show that DYX1C1 interacts with both ERs in the presence of 17beta-estradiol, as determined by co-localization, co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays. Protein levels of endogenous ERalpha or exogenous ERbeta were reduced upon over-expression of DYX1C1, resulting in decreased transcriptional responses to 17beta-estradiol. Furthermore, we detected in vivo complexes of DYX1C1 with ERalpha or ERbeta at endogenous levels along neurites of primary rat hippocampal neurons. Taken together, our data suggest that DYX1C1 is involved in the regulation of ERalpha and ERbeta, and may thus affect the brain development and regulate cognitive functions. These findings provide novel insights into the function of DYX1C1 and link neuronal migration and developmental dyslexia to the estrogen-signaling effects in the brain.",

Two src family tyrosine kinases, p60c-src and p56lck, phosphorylated the purified recombinant hER on tyrosine-537 in vitro. In addition, two tyrosine phosphatases, protein tyrosine phosphatase-1B and src homology-2 protein tyrosine phosphatase-1, dephosphorylated phosphotyrosine-537 of the hER in vitro.

Ectopic expression of the ERalpha reduced cell numbers in ER+ and ER- breast cancer cell lines while NF-kappaB-binding activity and the expression of several NF-kappaB-regulated proteins were reduced in ER- cells. ER overexpression in ER+/E2-independent LCC1 cells only weakly inhibited the predominant p50 NF-kappaB. GST-ERalpha fusion protein pull downs and in vivo co-immunoprecipitations of NF-kappaB:ERalpha complexes showed that the ERalpha interacts with p50 and p65 in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of NF-kappaB increased the expression of diverse E2-regulated proteins. p50 differentially associated directly with the ER:ERE complex in LCC1 and MCF-7 cells by supershift analysis while p65 antibody reduced ERalpha:ERE complexes in the absence of a supershift. ChIP analysis demonstrated that NF-kappaB proteins are present on an endogenous ERE. Together these results demonstrate that the ER and NF-kappaB undergo mutual repression, which may explain, in part, why expression of the ERalpha in ER- cells does not confer growth signaling. Secondly, the acquisition of E2-independence in ER+ cells is associated with predominantly p50:p50 NF-kappaB, which may reflect alterations in the ER in these cells. Since the p50 homodimer is less sensitive to the presence of the ER, this may allow for the activation of both pathways in the same cell.",

The woman was heterozygous for a single-base mutation that converted the codon for glycine 619 of the alpha 1(III) chain of type III procollagen to a codon for arginine. Studies on cultured skin fibroblasts demonstrated the mutation caused synthesis of type III procollagen that had a decreased temperature for thermal unfolding of the protein.

Complementation of an Escherichia coli strain lacking this activity has allowed isolation of cDNA encoding this enzyme from a human muscle library. Two forms were identified and the nucleotide sequence of each was determined; they were found to differ only in the 5' region and we suggest that these arise from the use of a different first exon in the two transcripts. These nucleotide sequences are different from that of the cDNA which was isolated previously from a human liver library [Peng, H.-L. & Chang, H.-Y. (1993) FEBS Lett. 329, 153-158] and it is proposed that these liver and muscle forms are derived from different genes. The cDNA for muscle form I, muscle form II, the liver form, and the liver form fused to part of the lacZ gene were expressed in Escherichia coli and the kinetic properties of each enzyme were characterised. Muscle form I and the LacZ/liver fusion enzyme exhibit Michaelis-Menten kinetics towards all substrates while muscle form II has a sigmoidal dependence of rate upon the concentration of MgPPi. The liver form shows Michaelis-Menten kinetics towards MgUTP. For the remaining three substrates, complex kinetics were observed involving a combination of sigmoidicity at low substrate concentration and partial inhibition at high substrate concentration.",

Ten males were from five families, and the remaining 15 males and three females were apparently sporadic cases. Molecular studies were performed for Kallmann syndrome 1 (KAL1) and fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1, also known as KAL2) by sequence analysis for all the coding exons, by PCR-based deletion analysis, and by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis, showing six novel and two recurrent intragenic KAL1 mutations in seven familial and four sporadic male cases and two novel intragenic FGFR1 mutations in two sporadic male cases. In addition, submicroscopic deletions at Xp22.3 involving VCX-A, STS, KAL1, and OA1 were identified in three familial cases and one sporadic male case affected by a contiguous gene syndrome. Clinical assessment in the 15 males with KAL1 mutations showed normal and borderline olfactory function in two males and right-side dominant renal lesion in seven males, in addition to variable degrees of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) in all the 15 males and olfactory dysfunction in 13 males. The two males with FGFR1 mutations had HH and anosmia and lacked other features. Clinical features in the remaining 11 cases with no demonstrable KAL1 or FGFR1 mutations included right renal aplasia in one female, cleft palate in one male, cleft palate and perceptive deafness in one male, and dental agenesis and perceptive deafness in one male, in addition to a variable extent of HH and olfactory dysfunction. The results suggest the following: 1) KAL1 mutations might be more prevalent in the Japanese patients than previously estimated in the Caucasian patients and can be associated with apparently normal olfactory function; 2) FGFR1 mutations account for approximately 10% of KS patients, as previously reported in the Caucasian patients, and can result in HH and olfactory dysfunction-only phenotype; and 3) renal aplasia, which is characteristic of KAL1 mutations, and cleft palate and dental agenesis, which are characteristic of FGFR1 mutations, can occur in patients without KAL1 and FGFR1 mutations.",

        "abstracttext": "In this study, we demonstrate that receptor-associated protein 80 (RAP80) interacts with estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) in an agonist-dependent manner. The interaction is specific for ERalpha as ERbeta and several other nuclear receptors tested did not interact with RAP80. Interaction between RAP80 and ERalpha was supported by mammalian two-hybrid, GST pull-down, and co-immunoprecipitation analyses. The hinge/ligand-binding domain of ERalpha is sufficient for interaction with RAP80. RAP80 overexpression reduces ERalpha polyubiquitination, increases the level of ERalpha protein, and enhances ERalpha-mediated transactivation. Knockdown of endogenous RAP80 expression by small-interfering RNA (siRNA) reduced ERalpha protein level and the E2-dependent induction of pS2. In this study, we also demonstrate that RAP80 contains two functional ubiquitin-interaction motifs (UIMs) that are able to bind ubiquitin and to direct monoubiquitination of RAP80. Deletion of these UIMs does not affect the ability of RAP80 to interact with ERalpha, but eliminates the effects of RAP80 on ERalpha polyubiquitination, the level of ERalpha protein, and ERalpha-mediated transcription. These data indicate that the UIMs in RAP80 are critical for the function of RAP80. Our study identifies ERalpha as a new RAP80-interacting protein and suggests that RAP80 may be an important modulator of ERalpha activity.",

In this study, we have isolated human fgr cDNA molecules from normal monocyte mRNA templates. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the longest fgr cDNA revealed a 5' untranslated region of 927 bp which included two Alu-like repeats as well as three translation stop codons immediately upstream of the initiator for p55c-fgr synthesis. Within genomic DNA, these sequences were distributed over 13 kbp as three distinct 5' untranslated exons. Previous studies have shown that Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) increases c-fgr mRNA levels in B lymphocytes. By comparing the nucleotide sequence reported for transcripts isolated from EBV-infected B lymphocytes with those of our monocyte cDNA as well as genomic DNA, we identified a novel untranslated exon utilized only in EBV-infected cells. The transcriptional initiation sites of fgr mRNA expressed in EBV-converted cells were mapped and shown to reside within a region identified as an intron for fgr mRNA that is expressed in normal myelomonocytic cells. Furthermore, the region of the fgr locus upstream of the novel exon displayed properties of a transcriptional promoter when transfected into heterologous cells. We conclude from all of these findings that activation of the fgr gene by EBV is achieved by mechanisms distinct from those normally regulating its programmed expression in myelomonocytic cells.",

Although the ligand specificity of alpha(3)beta(1) has been controversial, current literature indicates that alpha(3)beta(1) ligand recognition is independent of RGD. We compared alpha(3)beta(1) to the RGD-binding integrin, alpha(V)beta(3), for binding to envelope-associated gB and a gB(RGD) peptide. Adhesion assays demonstrated that beta(3)-CHO cells overexpressing alpha(V)beta(3) specifically bound gB(RGD), whereas alpha(3)-CHO cells overexpressing alpha(3)beta(1) did not. Function-blocking antibodies to alpha(V)beta(3) inhibited the adhesion of HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells to gB(RGD), while antibodies to alpha(3)beta(1) did not. Using affinity-purified integrins and confocal microscopy, alpha(V)beta(3) bound to gB(RGD) and KSHV virions, demonstrating direct receptor-ligand interactions. Specific alpha(V)beta(3) antagonists, including cyclic and dicyclic RGD peptides and alpha(V)beta(3) function-blocking antibodies, inhibited KSHV infection by 70 to 80%. Keratinocytes from alpha(3)-null mice lacking alpha(3)beta(1) were fully competent for infection by KSHV, and reconstitution of alpha(3)beta(1) function by transfection with alpha(3) cDNA reduced KSHV infectivity from 74% to 55%. Additional inhibitory effects of alpha(3)beta(1) on the cell surface expression of alpha(V)beta(3) and on alpha(V)beta(3)-mediated adhesion of alpha(3)-CHO cells overexpressing alpha(3)beta(1) were detected, consistent with previous reports of transdominant inhibition of alpha(V)beta(3) function by alpha(3)beta(1). These observations may explain previous reports of an inhibition of KSHV infection by soluble alpha(3)beta(1). Our studies demonstrate that alpha(V)beta(3) is a cellular receptor mediating both the cell adhesion and entry of KSHV into target cells through binding the virion-associated gB(RGD).",

One of the most commonly deleted subregions contains the SDHD gene, which encodes the small subunit of cytochrome b (cybS) in mitochondrial complex II (succinate-ubiquinone oxidoreductase). Germline mutations in SDHD cause hereditary paraganglioma type 1 (PGL1), and suggest a tumour suppressor role for cybS. We present a high-resolution physical map spanning SDHD, covered by 19 YACs and 20 BACs. An approximate 1.1-Mb gene-rich region around SDHD is spanned by a complete BAC contig. Twenty-six new STSs are developed from the BAC clone ends.

        "abstracttext": "Protein kinase inhibitors with enhanced selectivity can be designed by optimizing binding interactions with less conserved inactive conformations because such inhibitors will be less likely to compete with ATP for binding and therefore may be less impacted by high intracellular concentrations of ATP. Analysis of the ATP-binding cleft in a number of inactive protein kinases, particularly in the autoinhibited conformation, led to the identification of a previously undisclosed non-polar region in this cleft. This ATP-incompatible hydrophobic region is distinct from the previously characterized hydrophobic allosteric back pocket, as well as the main pocket. Generalized hypothetical models of inactive kinases were constructed and, for the work described here, we selected the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) tyrosine kinase family as a case study. Initial optimization of a FGFR2 inhibitor identified from a library of commercial compounds was guided using structural information from the model. We describe the inhibitory characteristics of this compound in biophysical, biochemical, and cell-based assays, and have characterized the binding mode using x-ray crystallographic studies. The results demonstrate, as expected, that these inhibitors prevent activation of the autoinhibited conformation, retain full inhibitory potency in the presence of physiological concentrations of ATP, and have favorable inhibitory activity in cancer cells. Given the widespread regulation of kinases by autoinhibitory mechanisms, the approach described herein provides a new paradigm for the discovery of inhibitors by targeting inactive conformations of protein kinases.",

In three cases with the mutation G1012R, G1018V, or G1021E, cells in the dermis had extremely dilated rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), the dermis was thin, and there was a reduced proportion of collagen although the proportion of elastic fibers appeared increased.

K. (1988) EMBO J. 7, 4119-4127). The findings provide evidence that the alpha 2M receptor and LRP are the same molecule. Further evidence comes from immunoprecipitation experiments using a monoclonal antibody specific for the alpha 2M receptor that show this molecule, like LRP, to contain two polypeptides of approximately 420 and 85 kDa that are noncovalently associated. An additional component of this receptor system is a 39-kDa polypeptide that co-purifies with the alpha 2M receptor during affinity chromatography. Solid phase binding studies reveal that the 39-kDa polypeptide binds with high affinity (Kd = 18 nM) to the 420-kDa component of the alpha 2M receptor. The apparent identity of LRP and the alpha 2M receptor suggests that this molecule is a multifunctional receptor with the capacity to bind diverse biological ligands and highlights a possible relationship between two previously unrelated biological processes, lipid metabolism and proteinase regulation.",

Moreover, although the human sequence has a high density of segmental duplication, the mouse sequence has a very low density.

The availability of entire genome sequences has rendered feasible the systematic screening of collections of proteins, often of unknown function, aimed to find the cognate ligands. Once identified by genetic and/or biochemical approaches, the interaction between two proteins should be validated in the physiologic environment. Herein we describe an experimental strategy to screen collections of protein-protein interaction domains to find and validate candidate interactors. The approach is based on the assumption that the overexpression in cultured cells of protein-protein interaction domains, isolated from the context of the whole protein, could titrate the endogenous ligand and, in turn, exert a dominant negative effect. The identification of the ligand could provide us with a tool to check the relevance of the interaction because the contemporary overexpression of the isolated domain and of its ligand could rescue the dominant negative phenotype. We explored this approach by analyzing the possible dominant negative effects on the cell cycle progression of a collection of phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domains of human proteins. Of 47 PTB domains, we found that the overexpression of 10 of them significantly interfered with the cell cycle progression of NIH3T3 cells. Four of them were used as baits to identify the cognate interactors. Among these proteins, CARM1, interacting with the PTB domain of RabGAP1, and EF1alpha, interacting with RGS12, were able to rescue the block of the cell cycle induced by the isolated PTB domain of the partner protein, thus confirming in vivo the relevance of the interaction. These results suggest that the described approach can be used for the systematic screening of the ligands of various protein-protein interaction domains also by using different biological assays.",

The chromosome is remarkable in having the lowest rate of segmental duplication in the genome. It also includes a chemokine receptor gene cluster as well as numerous loci involved in multiple human cancers such as the gene encoding FHIT, which contains the most common constitutive fragile site in the genome, FRA3B. Using genomic sequence from chimpanzee and rhesus macaque, we were able to characterize the breakpoints defining a large pericentric inversion that occurred some time after the split of Homininae from Ponginae, and propose an evolutionary history of the inversion.",

The composition of this p102-containing protein complex resembles that of the Golgi coatomer complex, which constitutes the coat of non-clathrin coated vesicles. One of the subunits of the p102 complex reacts with a monoclonal antibody that detects beta-COP, a subunit of the Golgi coatomer complex. Like beta-COP, p102 exists in a brefeldin A-sensitive association with Golgi membranes. The sequence of p102 contains an N-terminal domain composed of six repeats which are similar to those found in the beta subunit of trimeric G proteins and other regulatory proteins.

Sequence analysis of the N-sam cDNAs showed that N-sam encodes a human FGF receptor, the FLG protein. N-sam was expressed in lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma cells, predominantly in the thymic T-cell phenotype. In a T-cell leukemia line, MOLT3, N-sam mRNA expression was markedly enhanced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate treatment and was also up-regulated by basic FGF exposure. These results indicate that N-sam expression is regulated during T-cell ontogeny and modulated by its putative ligand exposure.

One branch of the kinome network is the evolutionarily conserved NIMA-related serine/threonine kinases (Neks). Most of the 11 mammalian Neks studied so far are related to cell cycle regulation, and due to association with diverse human pathologies, Neks are promising chemotherapeutic targets. Human Nek6 was associated to carcinogenesis, but its interacting partners and signaling pathways remain elusive. Here we introduce hNek6 as a highly connected member in the human kinase interactome. In a more global context, we performed a broad data bank comparison based on degree distribution analysis and found that the human kinome is enriched in hubs. Our networks include a broad set of novel hNek6 interactors as identified by our yeast two-hybrid screens classified into 18 functional categories. All of the tested interactions were confirmed, and the majority of tested substrates were phosphorylated in vitro by hNek6. Notably, we found that hNek6 N-terminal is important to mediate the interactions with its partners. Some novel interactors also colocalized with hNek6 and \u03b3-tubulin in human cells, pointing to a possible centrosomal interaction. The interacting proteins link hNek6 to novel pathways, for example, Notch signaling and actin cytoskeleton regulation, or give new insights on how hNek6 may regulate previously proposed pathways such as cell cycle regulation, DNA repair response, and NF-\u03baB signaling. Our findings open new perspectives in the study of hNek6 role in cancer by analyzing its novel interactions in specific pathways in tumor cells, which may provide important implications for drug design and cancer therapy.",

        "abstracttext": "The study of protein glycosylation has lagged far behind the progress of current proteomics because of the enormous complexity, wide dynamic range distribution and low stoichiometric modification of glycoprotein. Solid phase extraction of tryptic N-glycopeptides by hydrazide chemistry is becoming a popular protocol for the analysis of N-glycoproteome. However, in silico digestion of proteins in human proteome database by trypsin indicates that a significant percentage of tryptic N-glycopeptides is not in the preferred detection mass range of shotgun proteomics approach, that is, from 800 to 3500 Da. And the quite big size of glycan groups may block trypsin to access the K, R residues near N-glycosites for digestion, which will result in generation of big glycopeptides. Thus many N-glycosites could not be localized if only trypsin was used to digest proteins. Herein, we describe a comprehensive way to analyze the N-glycoproteome of human liver tissue by combination of hydrazide chemistry method and multiple enzyme digestion. The lysate of human liver tissue was digested with three proteases, that is, trypsin, pepsin and thermolysin, with different specificities, separately. Use of trypsin alone resulted in identification of 622 N-glycosites, while using pepsin and thermolysin resulted in identification of 317 additional N-glycosites. Among the 317 additional N-glycosites, 98 (30.9%) could not be identified by trypsin in theory because the corresponding in silico tryptic peptides are either too small or too big to detect in mass spectrometer. This study clearly demonstrated that the coverage of N-glycosites could be significantly increased due to the adoption of multiple enzyme digestion. A total number of 939 N-glycosites were identified confidently, covering 523 noredundant glycoproteins from human liver tissue, which leads to the establishment of the largest data set of glycoproteome from human liver up to now.",

From these data, we identified a core hESC phosphoproteome of sites with similar robust changes in response to the two distinct treatments. These sites exhibited distinct dynamic phosphorylation patterns, which were linked to known or predicted kinases on the basis of the matching sequence motif. In addition to identifying previously unknown phosphorylation sites on factors associated with differentiation, such as kinases and transcription factors, we observed dynamic phosphorylation of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). We found a specific interaction of DNMTs during early differentiation with the PAF1 (polymerase-associated factor 1) transcriptional elongation complex, which binds to promoters of the pluripotency and known DNMT target genes encoding OCT4 and NANOG, thereby providing a possible molecular link for the silencing of these genes during differentiation.",

We isolated a nuclear factor (designated ASC-2) with such properties by using the ligand-binding domain of retinoid X receptor as a bait in a yeast two-hybrid screening. ASC-2 also interacted with other nuclear receptors, including retinoic acid receptor, thyroid hormone receptor, estrogen receptor alpha, and glucocorticoid receptor, basal factors TFIIA and TBP, and transcription integrators CBP/p300 and SRC-1. In transient cotransfections, ASC-2, either alone or in conjunction with CBP/p300 and SRC-1, stimulated ligand-dependent transactivation by wild type nuclear receptors but not mutant receptors lacking the AF2 domain. Consistent with an idea that ASC-2 is essential for the nuclear receptor function in vivo, microinjection of anti-ASC-2 antibody abrogated the ligand-dependent transactivation of retinoic acid receptor, and this repression was fully relieved by coinjection of ASC-2-expression vector. Surprisingly, ASC-2 was identical to a gene previously identified during a search for genes amplified and overexpressed in breast and other human cancers. From these results, we concluded that ASC-2 is a bona fide transcription coactivator molecule of nuclear receptors, and its altered expression may contribute to the development of cancers.",

We have previously shown that autophosphorylated tyrosine 766 in FGFR1 serves as a binding site for one of the SH2 domains of phospholipase Cy and couples FGFR1 to phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis in several cell types. In this report, we describe the identification of six additional autophosphorylation sites (Y-463, Y-583, Y-585, Y-653, Y-654 and Y-730) on FGFR1. We demonstrate that autophosphorylation on tyrosines 653 and 654 is important for activation of tyrosine kinase activity of FGFR1 and is therefore essential for FGFR1-mediated biological responses. In contrast, autophosphorylation of the remaining four tyrosines is dispensable for FGFR1-mediated mitogen-activated protein kinase activation and mitogenic signaling in L-6 cells as well as neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells. Interestingly, both the wild-type and a mutant FGFR1 (FGFR1-4F) are able to phosphorylate Shc and an unidentified Grb2-associated phosphoprotein of 90 kDa (pp90). Binding of the Grb2/Sos complex to phosphorylated Shc and pp90 may therefore be the key link between FGFR1 and the Ras signaling pathway, mito-genesis, and neuronal differentiation.",

Here, we describe a new androgen receptor (AR)-associated coactivator, PRMT2, which belongs to the arginine methyltransferase protein family. To search for AR-interacting proteins a fragment of the AR was used in a library screen exploiting the yeast two-hybrid technique and identifying the C-terminal region of PRMT2. We demonstrated that PRMT2 acts as a strong coactivator of the AR, had modest or none influence on transcriptional activation mediated by other NRs. Interestingly, PRMT2 interaction with the estrogen receptor (ER) was strongly dependent on the cellular background, thus, suggesting the involvement of additional, differentially expressed coregulators. We also demonstrated synergistic interaction of PRMT2 with other known nuclear receptor coactivators, such as GRIP1/TIF-2. Potentiation of AR-mediated transactivation by PRMT2 alone and in synergism with GRIP1 was prevented by a competitive inhibitor of methyltransferase activity. The PRMT2 expression profile overlaps with the distribution of AR, with strongest PRMT2 abundance in androgen target tissues. Immunofluorescence experiments showed that the intracellular localization of PRMT2 depends on the presence of the cognate receptor ligand. Under androgen-free conditions, both AR and PRMT2 are confined to the cytoplasm, whereas in the presence of androgens both proteins colocalize and translocate into the nucleus. Treatment with the AR antagonist hydroxyflutamide results in nuclear translocation of the AR, but not the coactivator PRMT2. Thus, it appears that the ligand-dependent AR conformation is essential for the recruitment and nuclear translocation of PMRT2 which acts as AR-coactivator, presumably by arginine methylation.",

Through electrophoretic mobility shift (EMSA), chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and re-ChIP assays, we investigated the binding of ERalpha and four members of the AP-1 family (c-Jun, c-fos, Fra-2, and ATF2) to a region located approximately 800 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site of exon F of the human ERalpha gene in SaOS-2 osteoblast-like cells. Reporter gene assay experiments in combination with DNA binding assays demonstrated that F promoter activity is under the control of upstream cis-acting elements which are recognized by specific combinations of ERalpha, c-Jun, c-fos, and ATF2 homo- and heterodimers. Moreover, ChIP and re-ChIP experiments showed that these nuclear factors bind the F promoter in vivo with a simultaneous occupancy stimulated by 17-beta-estradiol.

Here we identify the AT(4) receptor, by protein purification and peptide sequencing, to be insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP). HEK 293T cells transfected with IRAP exhibit typical AT(4) receptor binding characteristics; the AT(4) receptor ligands, angiotensin IV and LVV-hemorphin 7, compete for the binding of [(125)I]Nle(1)-angiotensin IV with IC(50) values of 32 and 140 nm, respectively. The distribution of IRAP and its mRNA in the brain, determined by immunohistochemistry and hybridization histochemistry, parallels that of the AT(4) receptor determined by radioligand binding. We also show that AT(4) receptor ligands dose-dependently inhibit the catalytic activity of IRAP. We have therefore demonstrated that the AT(4) receptor is IRAP and propose that AT(4) receptor ligands may exert their effects by inhibiting the catalytic activity of IRAP thereby extending the half-life of its neuropeptide substrates.",

It is implicated in diverse biological processes both as an endocytic receptor and as a signaling molecule. Recent reports show that LRP undergoes sequential proteolytic cleavage in the ectodomain and transmembrane domain. The latter cleavage, mediated by the Alzheimer-related gamma-secretase activity that also cleaves amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Notch, results in the release of the LRP cytoplasmic domain (LRPICD) fragment. This relatively small cytoplasmic fragment has several motifs by which LRP interacts with various intracellular adaptor and scaffold proteins. However, the function of this fragment is largely unknown. Here we show that the LRPICD is translocated to the nucleus, where it colocalizes in the nucleus with a transcription modulator, Tip60, which is known to interact with Fe65 and with the APP-derived intracellular domain. LRPICD dramatically inhibits APP-derived intracellular domain/Fe65 transactivation mediated by Tip60. LRPICD has a close interaction with Tip60 in the nucleus, as shown by a fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay. These observations suggest that LRPICD has a novel signaling function, negatively impacting transcriptional activity of the APP, Fe65, and Tip60 complex in the nucleus, and shed new light on the function of LRP in transcriptional modulation.",

Three of these clones (fibrillin2/KIAA1776, MEGF10/KIAA1780 and MEGF11/KIAA1781) were isolated as genes encoding proteins with multiple EGF-like domains by motif-trap screening. The average sizes of the inserts and corresponding open reading frames of eDNA clones analyzed here reached 4.7 kb and 2.4 kb (785 amino acid residues), respectively. From the results of homology and motif searches against the public databases, the functional categories of the predicted gene products of 54 genes were determined; 93% of these predicted gene products (50 gene products) were classified as proteins related to cell signaling/communication, nucleic acid management, or cell structure/motility. To collect additional information on these genes, their expression profiles were also studied in 10 human tissues, 8 brain regions, spinal cord, fetal brain and fetal liver by reverse transcription-coupled polymerase chain reaction, products of which were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.",

However, the p.N77K and p.R822C changes were also found in two and one out of 150 healthy control individuals, respectively, and therefore, their pathogenic effect is questionable. Notably, three alterations (p.E324X, p.S332C, c.1081G>C) are located in the alternative exon 8B that codes for the FGFR1c isoform, thus indicating that this isoform plays a crucial role in the development of the olfactory system in man. Moreover, the presence of cleft palate in a patient carrying the p.E324X change shows that FGFR1c is important for palate morphogenesis too.",

The hormone-bound hERalphaLBD forms a distinctly different and probably more physiologically important dimer interface than its progesterone counterpart. A comparison of the specificity determinants of hormone binding reveals a common structural theme of mutually supported van der Waals and hydrogen-bonded interactions involving highly conserved residues. The previously suggested mechanism by which the estrogen receptor distinguishes estradiol's unique 3-hydroxy group from the 3-keto function of most other steroids is now described in atomic detail. Mapping of mutagenesis results points to a coactivator-binding surface that includes the region around the \"signature sequence\" as well as helix 12, where the ligand-dependent conformation of the activation function 2 core is similar in all previously solved steroid/nuclear receptor LBDs. A peculiar crystal packing event displaces helix 12 in the hERalphaLBD reported here, suggesting a higher degree of dynamic variability than expected for this critical substructure.",

SHMT is a highly conserved protein with the human isozymes retaining about 43% sequence identity with the E. coli protein. The human cytosolic and mitochondrial SHMT genes were localized to chromosome regions 17p11.2 and 12q13, respectively. The high degree of nucleotide sequence identity between the two isozymes, and the presence of keratin genes in both chromosomal regions, is consistent with these regions of chromosome 12 and 17 arising by a duplication event.",

Transient transfection assays further demonstrate that RAP250 has a large intrinsic glutamine-rich activation domain and can significantly enhance the transcriptional activity of several nuclear receptors, acting as a coactivator. Interestingly, Northern blot and in situ hybridization analyses reveal that RAP250 is widely expressed with the highest expression in reproductive organs (testis, prostate and ovary) and brain.

        "abstracttext": "The Wnt signaling plays pivotal roles in embryogenesis and cancer, and the three DIX domain-containing proteins, Dvl, Axin, and Ccd1, play distinct roles in the initiation and regulation of canonical Wnt signaling. Overexpressed Dvl has a tendency to form large polymers in a cytoplasmic punctate pattern, whereas the biologically active Dvl in fact forms low molecular weight oligomers. The molecular basis for how the polymeric sizes of Dvl proteins are controlled upon Wnt signaling remains unclear. Here we show that Ccd1 up-regulates canonical Wnt signaling via acting synergistically with Dvl. We determined the crystal structures of wild type Ccd1-DIX and mutant Dvl1-DIX(Y17D), which pack into \"head-to-tail\" helical filaments. Structural analyses reveal two sites crucial for intra-filament homo- and hetero-interaction and a third site for inter-filament homo-assembly. Systematic mutagenesis studies identified critical residues from all three sites required for Dvl homo-oligomerization, puncta formation, and stimulation of Wnt signaling. Remarkably, Ccd1 forms a hetero-complex with Dvl through the \"head\" of Dvl-DIX and the \"tail\" of Ccd1-DIX, depolymerizes Dvl homo-assembly, and thereby controls the size of Dvl polymer. These data together suggest a molecular mechanism for Ccd1-mediated Wnt activation in that Ccd1 converts latent polymeric Dvl to a biologically active oligomer(s).",

We studied the structure of the COL3A1 gene of an individual with EDS type IV and that of her phenotypically normal parents. The proband was heterozygous for a 2-kb deletion in COL3A1, while her father was mosaic for the same deletion in somatic and germ cells. In fibroblasts from the father, approximately two-fifths of the COL3A1 alleles carried the deletion, but only 10% of the COL3A1 alleles in white blood cells were of the mutant species. The deletion in the mutant allele extended from intron 7 into intron 11. There was a 12-bp direct repeat in intron 7 and intron 11, the latter about 60 bp 5' to the junction. At the breakpoint there was a duplication of 10 bp from intron 11 separated by an insertion of 4 bp contained within the duplicated sequence. The father was mosaic for the deletion so that the gene rearrangement occurred during his early embryonic development prior to lineage allocation. These findings suggest that at least some of the deletions seen in human genes may occur during replication, rather than as a consequence of meiotic crossing-over, and that they thus have a risk for recurrence when observed de novo.",

Here, we characterize a family of human Dkk-related genes composed of Dkk-1, Dkk-2, Dkk-3, and Dkk-4, together with a unique Dkk-3 related protein termed Soggy (Sgy). hDkks 1-4 contain two distinct cysteine-rich domains in which the positions of 10 cysteine residues are highly conserved between family members. Sgy is a novel secreted protein related to Dkk-3 but which lacks the cysteine-rich domains. Members of the Dkk-related family display unique patterns of mRNA expression in human and mouse tissues, and are secreted when expressed in 293T cells. Furthermore, secreted hDkk-2 and hDkk-4 undergo proteolytic processing which results in cleavage of the second cysteine-rich domain from the full-length protein. Members of the human Dkk-related family differ not only in their structures and expression patterns, but also in their abilities to inhibit Wnt signaling. hDkk-1 and hDkk-4, but not hDkk-2, hDkk-3 or Sgy, suppress Wnt-induced secondary axis induction in Xenopus embryos. hDkk-1 and hDkk-4 do not block axis induction triggered either by Xenopus Dishevelled (Xdsh) or Xenopus Frizzled-8 (Xfz8), both of which function to transduce signals from Wnt ligands. Thus, hDkks 1 and 4 may inhibit Wnt activity by a mechanism upstream of Frizzled. Our findings highlight the structural and functional heterogeneity of human Dkk-related proteins.",

These molecules, designated CEPs, contain three regions of homology, including a Cdc42 binding domain and two unique domains called CI and CII. Experimentally, we have verified that CEP2 and CEP5 bind Cdc42. Expression of CEP2, CEP3, CEP4, and CEP5 in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts induced pseudopodia formation. Fibroblasts coexpressing dominant negative Cdc42 with CEP2 or expressing a Cdc42/Rac interactive binding domain mutant of CEP2 did not induce pseudopodia formation. In primary keratinocytes, CEP2- and CEP5-expressing cells showed reduced F-actin localization at the adherens junctions with an increase in thin stress fibers that extended the length of the cell body. Keratinocytes expressing CEPs also showed an altered vinculin distribution and a loss of E-cadherin from adherens junctions. Similar effects were observed in keratinocytes expressing constitutively active Cdc42, but were not seen with a Cdc42/Rac interactive binding domain mutant of CEP2.

In this study we report that the nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences for human testicular inhibin beta-B-subunit are similar to those of human ovary. In rat testis two species of beta-B-subunit mRNA [4.4 and 3.3 kilobases (kb)] appeared to be present in equal concentration, as opposed to rat ovary where a predominant band of 4.4 kb and a minor band of 3.3 kb were observed. One major species of beta-A-subunit mRNA (6.5 kb) was identified in both testis and ovary. The concentration of beta-A-subunit mRNA in the testis was very low, representing only 0.5% of that in rat ovary. The accumulation of beta-B-subunit mRNA peaked at 20 days of age and declined thereafter in a pattern similar to that of the alpha-subunit gene. Hypophysectomy caused a marked increase in the concentration as well as the total content of beta-B-subunit but no change in beta-A-subunit mRNA in rat testis. We have previously reported that FSH markedly increased alpha-subunit mRNA levels both in vivo and in vitro. By contrast, neither FSH nor testosterone has any significant effect on the accumulation of beta-A- or beta-B-subunit mRNAs in hypophysectomized animals or Sertoli cell primary cultures. We conclude that 1) the mRNAs for both beta-subunits are not regulated by FSH; and 2) hypophysectomy does not change and increases, respectively, the mRNAs for the beta-A- and beta-B-subunits. We conclude that the inhibin subunit mRNAs are differentially regulated in rat testis.",

We demonstrate that NPP4 is present on the surface of vascular endothelium, where it hydrolyzes Ap3A into AMP and ADP, and Ap4A into AMP and ATP. Platelet aggregation assays with citrated platelet-rich plasma reveal that the primary and secondary waves of aggregation and dense granule release are strongly induced by nanomolar NPP4 in a concentration-dependent manner in the presence of Ap3A, while Ap3A alone initiates a primary wave of aggregation followed by rapid disaggregation. NPP2 and an active site NPP4 mutant, neither of which appreciably hydrolyzes Ap3A, have no effect on platelet aggregation and secretion. Finally, by using ADP receptor blockade we confirm that NPP4 mediates platelet aggregation via release of ADP from Ap3A and activation of ADP receptors. Collectively, these studies define the biologic and enzymatic basis for NPP4 and Ap3A activity in platelet aggregation in vitro and suggest that NPP4 promotes hemostasis in vivo by augmenting ADP-mediated platelet aggregation at the site of vascular injury.",

We show that both serines are hypophosphorylated during early mitogenic stimulation and that hypophosphorylation correlates with peak Raf-1 activation. Concentrations of okadaic acid that selectively inhibit protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) induce phosphorylation of these residues and prevent maximal activation of the Raf-1 kinase. This effect is mediated via phosphorylation of serine 259. The PP2A core heterodimer forms complexes with Raf-1 in vivo and in vitro.

The ERAP140 protein shares no sequence and has little structural homology with other nuclear receptor cofactors. However, homologues of ERAP140 have been identified in mouse, Drosophila, and Caenorhabditis elegans. The expression of ERAP140 is cell and tissue type specific and is most abundant in the brain, where its expression is restricted to neurons. In addition to interacting with ER alpha, ERAP140 also binds ER beta, TR beta, PPAR gamma, and RAR alpha. ERAP140 interacts with ER alpha via a noncanonical interaction motif. The ER alpha-ERAP140 association can be competed by coactivator NR boxes, indicating ERAP140 binds ER alpha on a surface similar to that of other coactivators. ERAP140 can enhance the transcriptional activities of nuclear receptors with which it interacts. In vivo, ERAP140 is recruited by estrogen-bound ER alpha to the promoter region of endogenous ER alpha target genes. Furthermore, the E(2)-induced recruitment of ERAP140 to the promoter follows a cyclic pattern similar to that of other coactivators.

Disrupting ciliary organization leads to diseases called ciliopathies, with phenotypes ranging from retinal degeneration and cystic kidneys to neural tube defects. How proteins are selectively transported to and organized in the primary cilium remains unclear. Using a proteomic approach, we identified the ARL3 effector UNC119 as a binding partner of the myristoylated ciliopathy protein nephrocystin-3 (NPHP3). We mapped UNC119 binding to the N-terminal 200 residues of NPHP3 and found the interaction requires myristoylation. Creating directed mutants predicted from a structural model of the UNC119-myristate complex, we identified highly conserved phenylalanines within a hydrophobic \u03b2 sandwich to be essential for myristate binding. Furthermore, we found that binding of ARL3-GTP serves to release myristoylated cargo from UNC119. Finally, we showed that ARL3, UNC119b (but not UNC119a), and the ARL3 GAP Retinitis Pigmentosa 2 (RP2) are required for NPHP3 ciliary targeting and that targeting requires UNC119b myristoyl-binding activity. Our results uncover a selective, membrane targeting GTPase cycle that delivers myristoylated proteins to the ciliary membrane and suggest that other myristoylated proteins may be similarly targeted to specialized membrane domains.",

Here, we addressed the reverse process driven by phosphoinositide phosphatases and uncovered a key negative regulatory role in autophagy of a phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) phosphatase Jumpy (MTMR14). Jumpy associated with autophagic isolation membranes and early autophagosomes, defined by the key factor Atg16 necessary for proper localization and development of autophagic organelles. Jumpy orchestrated orderly succession of Atg factors by controlling recruitment to autophagic membranes of the sole mammalian Atg factor that interacts with PI3P, WIPI-1 (Atg18), and by affecting the distribution of Atg9 and LC3, the two Atg factors controlling organization and growth of autophagic membranes. A catalytically inactive Jumpy mutant, R336Q, found in congenital disease centronuclear myopathy, lost the ability to negatively regulate autophagy. This work reports for the first time that initiation of autophagy is controlled not only by the forward reaction of generating PI3P through a lipid kinase but that its levels are controlled by a specific PI3P phosphatase, which when defective can lead to human disease.",

Taken together, these data suggest that Brx represents a novel modular protein that may integrate cytoplasmic signaling pathways involving Rho family GTPases and nuclear hormone receptors.",

        "abstracttext": "Stimulation of growth factor receptors with tyrosine kinase activity is followed by rapid receptor dimerization, tyrosine autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of signalling molecules such as phospholipase C gamma (PLC gamma) and the ras GTPase-activating protein. PLC gamma and GTPase-activating protein bind to specific tyrosine-phosphorylated regions in growth factor receptors through their src-homologous SH2 domains. Growth factor-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC gamma is essential for stimulation of phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis in vitro and in vivo. We have shown that a short phosphorylated peptide containing tyrosine at position 766 from a conserved region of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor is a binding site for the SH2 domain of PLC gamma (ref. 8). Here we show that an FGF receptor point mutant in which Tyr 766 is replaced by a phenylalanine residue (Y766F) is unable to associate with and tyrosine-phosphorylate PLC gamma or to stimulate hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol. Nevertheless, the Y766F FGF receptor mutant can be autophosphorylated, and can phosphorylate several cellular proteins and stimulate DNA synthesis. Our data show that phosphorylation of the conserved Tyr 766 of the FGF receptor is essential for phosphorylation of PLC gamma and for hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol, but that elimination of this hydrolysis does not affect FGF-induced mitogenesis.",

However, the molecular mechanism by which DLC1 regulates the ER pathway remains poorly understood. To gain insights into the putative mechanism, here we set out to identify novel DLC1-interacting proteins. We identified KIBRA, a WW domain- and a glutamic acid stretch-containing protein, as a DLC1-binding protein and showed that it interacts with DLC1 both in vitro and in vivo. We found that KIBRA-DLC1 complex is recruited to ER-responsive promoters. We also found that KIBRA-DLC1 interaction is mandatory for the recruitment and transactivation functions of ER or DLC1 to the target chromatin. Finally we found that KIBRA interacts with histone H3 via its glutamic acid-rich region and that such interaction might play a mechanistic role in conferring an optimal ER transactivation function as well as the proliferation of ligand-stimulated breast cancer cells. Together these findings indicate that DLC1-KIBRA interaction is essential for ER transactivation in breast cancer cells.",

        "abstracttext": "PMEPA1 was identified originally as a highly androgen-inducible gene with prostate-abundant expression that was restricted to prostatic epithelial cells. PMEPA1 protein is a NEDD4 (ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase)-binding protein, which negatively regulates prostate cancer cell growth. In this study we establish that PMEPA1 is a direct transcriptional target of the androgen receptor (AR). We also demonstrate that PMEPA1 negatively regulates AR protein levels in different cell culture models. Transient expression of PMEPA1 down-regulates AR protein levels and AR transcriptional targets in prostate cancer cells. Conversely, knockdown of PMEPA1 leads to elevated levels of AR protein, AR transcriptional targets (prostate-specific antigen), and increased cell cycle S phase. We define that the PMEPA1-dependent down-regulation of AR is because of AR ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation. The mutant PMEPA1 (PY1/2 motif mutation) that is impaired in NEDD4 recruitment shows attenuated AR ubiquitination and AR protein down-regulation. These data support the hypothesis that PMEPA1 negatively regulates the stability of AR protein by enhancing AR ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation through NEDD4. The effect of PMEPA1 on AR ubiquitination and degradation appears to be MDM2-independent. Thus, the PMEPA1-AR degradation pathway may represent a new androgen-dependent mechanism for regulating AR levels in prostate epithelial cells. These findings underscore that the decreased PMEPA1 expression frequently noted in prostate cancers may lead to increased AR functions and strengthen the biological role of PMEPA1 in prostate cancers.",

Although the responsible enzymes are thought to be fairly well characterized, the lack of identified in vivo substrates, the occurrence of Nt-acetylation substrates displaying yet uncharacterized N-terminal acetyltransferase (NAT) specificities, and emerging evidence of posttranslational Nt-acetylation, necessitate the use of genetic models and quantitative proteomics. NatB, which targets Met-Glu-, Met-Asp-, and Met-Asn-starting protein N termini, is presumed to Nt-acetylate 15% of all yeast and 18% of all human proteins. We here report on the evolutionary traits of NatB from yeast to human and demonstrate that ectopically expressed hNatB in a yNatB-\u0394 yeast strain partially complements the natB-\u0394 phenotypes and partially restores the yNatB Nt-acetylome. Overall, combining quantitative N-terminomics with yeast studies and knockdown of hNatB in human cell lines, led to the unambiguous identification of 180 human and 110 yeast NatB substrates. Interestingly, these substrates included Met-Gln- N-termini, which are thus now classified as in vivo NatB substrates. We also demonstrate the requirement of hNatB activity for maintaining the structure and function of actomyosin fibers and for proper cellular migration. In addition, expression of tropomyosin-1 restored the altered focal adhesions and cellular migration defects observed in hNatB-depleted HeLa cells, indicative for the conserved link between NatB, tropomyosin, and actin cable function from yeast to human.",

PLC gamma physically associates with activated receptor tyrosine kinases, suggesting that it is a substrate for direct phosphorylation by these kinases. Here we report that a fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor with a single point mutation at residue 766 replacing tyrosine with phenylalanine fails to associate with PLC gamma in response to FGF. This mutant receptor also failed to mediate PtdIns hydrolysis and Ca2+ mobilization after FGF stimulation. However, the mutant receptor phosphorylated itself and several other cellular proteins, and it mediated mitogenesis in response to FGF.

We cloned the coding region of a retinoic acid-induced gene from a human thymus library, which was the mRNA encoding the 666-amino acid human homologue of mouse proline-rich protein 76. We have designated it RARP1 (retinoic acid response proline-rich protein 1). Transcription of an approximately 2.4-kbp mRNA occurred mainly in organs with immune functions, such as thymus, spleen, and peripheral leukocytes. Cycloheximide blocked the ATRA-induced expression. In megakaryocyte-like human erythroleukemia HEL cells, the amount of RARP1 mRNA was high, but it was low in human T-lymphoblastoid Jurkat cells. A specific antibody against RARP1 recognized a 110-kDa protein, which accumulates after incubation of HL-60 cells with ATRA. In immunohistochemical experiments, strong RARP1 staining was observed in the megakaryocytes of bone marrow and spleen, and heterogeneous stain was seen in thymus. Transcriptional studies showed that RARP1 expression impaired the transactivation through activator protein1 and serum response-element in all cell lines we checked, whereas it did not affect the transactivation through cAMP-response element in the same cell lines. Further analysis demonstrated that proline-rich regions of RARP1 are the functional regions regulated for suppression of activator protein1 transactivation. These data suggest that ATRA-inducible RARP1 selectively affects signal transduction and may contribute to myeloid and megakaryocytic differentiation.",

However, some pathogens can manipulate the autophagic pathway and replicate within the niche of generated autophagosome-like vesicles. By automated fluorescence-based high content analyses, we demonstrate that Staphylococcus aureus strains (USA300, HG001, SA113) stimulate autophagy and become entrapped in intracellular PtdIns(3)P-enriched vesicles that are decorated with human WIPI-1, an essential PtdIns(3)P effector of canonical autophagy and membrane protein of both phagophores and autophagosomes. Further, agr-positive S. aureus (USA300, HG001) strains were more efficiently entrapped in WIPI-1 positive autophagosome-like vesicles when compared to agr-negative cells (SA113). By confocal and electron microscopy we provide evidence that single- and multiple-Staphylococci entrapped undergo cell division. Moreover, the number of WIPI-1 positive autophagosome-like vesicles entrapping Staphylococci significantly increased upon (i) lysosomal inhibition by bafilomycin A(1) and (ii) blocking PIKfyve-mediated PtdIns(3,5)P(2) generation by YM201636. In summary, our results provide evidence that the PtdIns(3)P effector function of WIPI-1 is utilized during xenophagy of Staphylococcus aureus.

We observe that TIF2 is capable of interacting simultaneously with both the isolated N- and C-terminus of ER alpha in transfected mammalian cells and in vitro, indicating that TIF2 can bridge both receptor domains. The concomitant interaction of TIF2 with both AFs results in synergistic activation of transcription.

Here we show that stimulation of insulin secretion from INS-1 cells triggers the biosynthesis of pro-ICA512 and the degradation of its mature form. Inhibition of calpain, which is activated upon stimulation of insulin secretion, prevents the Ca2+-dependent proteolysis of ICA512. In vitro mu-calpain cleaves ICA512 between a putative PEST domain and the beta2-syntrophin binding site, whereas binding of ICA512 to beta2-syntrophin protects the former from cleavage. beta2-syntrophin and its F-actin-binding protein utrophin are enriched in subcellular fractions containing secretory granules. ICA512 preferentially binds phospho-beta2-syntrophin and stimulation of insulin secretion induces the Ca2+-dependent, okadaic acid-sensitive dephosphorylation of beta2-syntrophin. Similarly to calpeptin, okadaic acid inhibits ICA512 proteolysis and insulin secretion. Thus, stimulation of insulin secretion might promote the mobilization of secretory granules by inducing the dissociation of ICA512 from beta2-syntrophin-utrophin complexes and the cleavage of the ICA512 cytoplasmic tail by mu-calpain.",

Further, DLC1 expression led to enhanced recruitment of the DLC1-ER complex to the ER-target gene chromatin. Conversely, DLC1 downregulation compromised the ER-transactivation activity and also its nuclear accumulation, suggesting a potential chaperone-like activity of DLC1 in the nuclear translocation of ER. Together, these data define an unexpected upregulation of DLC1 by oestrogen and a previously unrecognized DLC1-ER interaction in supporting and amplifying ER-initiated cellular responses in breast cancer cells.",

Rearrangements and mutations of chromosome 1 are prevalent in cancer and many other diseases. Patterns of sequence variation reveal signals of recent selection in specific genes that may contribute to human fitness, and also in regions where no function is evident. Fine-scale recombination occurs in hotspots of varying intensity along the sequence, and is enriched near genes.

The gene expression profiling in the human hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis was catalogued by generating a large amount of expressed sequence tags (ESTs), followed by bioinformatics analysis (http://www.chgc.sh.cn/ database). Totally, 25,973 sequences of good quality were obtained from 31,130 clones (83.4%) from cDNA libraries of the hypothalamus, pituitary, and adrenal glands. After eliminating 5,347 sequences corresponding to repetitive elements and mtDNA, 20,626 ESTs could be assembled into 9, 175 clusters (3,979, 3,074, and 4,116 clusters in hypothalamus, pituitary, and adrenal glands, respectively) when overlapping ESTs were integrated. Of these clusters, 2,777 (30.3%) corresponded to known genes, 4,165 (44.8%) to dbESTs, and 2,233 (24.3%) to novel ESTs. The gene expression profiles reflected well the functional characteristics of the three levels in the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, because most of the 20 genes with highest expression showed statistical difference in terms of tissue distribution, including a group of tissue-specific functional markers. Meanwhile, some findings were made with regard to the physiology of the axis, and 200 full-length cDNAs of novel genes were cloned and sequenced. All of these data may contribute to the understanding of the neuroendocrine regulation of human life.",

As chromosome 15 is one of seven human chromosomes with a high rate of segmental duplication, we have carried out a detailed analysis of the duplication structure of the chromosome. Segmental duplications in chromosome 15 are largely clustered in two regions, on proximal and distal 15q; the proximal region is notable because recombination among the segmental duplications can result in deletions causing Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes. Sequence analysis shows that the proximal and distal regions of 15q share extensive ancient similarity. Using a simple approach, we have been able to reconstruct many of the events by which the current duplication structure arose. We find that most of the intrachromosomal duplications seem to share a common ancestry. Finally, we demonstrate that some remaining gaps in the genome sequence are probably due to structural polymorphisms between haplotypes; this may explain a significant fraction of the gaps remaining in the human genome.",

It has been demonstrated that the src homology region 2 (SH2 domain) of PLC-gamma and of other signalling molecules such as GTPase-activating protein and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-associated p85 direct their binding toward tyrosine-autophosphorylated regions of the epidermal growth factor or platelet-derived growth factor receptor. In this report, we describe the identification of Tyr-766 as an autophosphorylation site of flg-encoded FGFR by direct sequencing of a tyrosine-phosphorylated tryptic peptide isolated from the cytoplasmic domain of FGFR expressed in Escherichia coli. The same phosphopeptide was found in wild-type FGFR phosphorylated either in vitro or in living cells. Like other growth factor receptors, tyrosine-phosphorylated wild-type FGFR or its cytoplasmic domain becomes associated with intact PLC-gamma or with a fusion protein containing the SH2 domain of PLC-gamma. To delineate the site of association, we have examined the capacity of a 28-amino-acid tryptic peptide containing phosphorylated Tyr-766 to bind to various constructs containing SH2 and other domains of PLC-gamma. It is demonstrated that the tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide binds specifically to the SH2 domain but not to the SH3 domain or other regions of PLC-gamma. Hence, Tyr-766 and its flanking sequences represent a major binding site in FGFR for PLC-gamma. Alignment of the amino acid sequences surrounding Tyr-766 with corresponding regions of other FGFRs revealed conserved tyrosine residues in all known members of the FGFR family. We propose that homologous tyrosine-phosphorylated regions in other FGFRs also function as binding sites for PLC-gamma and therefore are involved in coupling to phosphatidylinositol breakdown.",

Northern blot analysis revealed that hNek6 transcripts are ubiquitously expressed with the highest expression found in the heart and skeletal muscle. Lower cell cycle-dependent expression of hNek6 transcripts was observed in the early G1 phase. GFP-fused hNek6 protein showed both nuclear and cytoplasmic localizations in HeLa cells. Fluorescence in situ hybridization using full-length hNek6 cDNA as a probe showed that the hNek6 gene is localized to human chromosome 9q33-34, a region at which the loss of heterozygosity is associated with transitional cell carcinomas. Importantly, recombinant hNek6 protein produced in insect cells effectively phosphorylated histones H1 and H3, but not casein.

They mediate cellular functions by binding to transmembrane FGF receptors, which are protein tyrosine kinases. FGF receptors are activated by oligomerization, and both this activation and FGF-stimulated biological responses require heparin-like molecules as well as FGF. Heparins are linear anionic polysaccharide chains; they are typically heterogeneously sulphated on alternating L-iduronic and D-glucosamino sugars, and are nearly ubiquitous in animal tissues as heparan sulphate proteoglycans on cell surfaces and in the extracellular matrix. Although several crystal structures have been described for FGF molecules in complexes with heparin-like sugars, the nature of a biologically active complex has been unknown until now. Here we describe the X-ray crystal structure, at 2.9 A resolution, of a biologically active dimer of human acidic FGF in a complex with a fully sulphated, homogeneous heparin decassacharide. The dimerization of heparin-linked acidic FGF observed here is an elegant mechanism for the modulation of signalling through combinatorial homodimerization and heterodimerization of the 12 known members of the FGF family.",

By generating specific antibodies, we show that both Nek6 and Nek7 are activated in mitosis and that interfering with their activity by either depletion or expression of reduced-activity mutants leads to mitotic arrest and apoptosis. Interestingly, while completely inactive mutants and small interfering RNA-mediated depletion delay cells at metaphase with fragile mitotic spindles, hypomorphic mutants or RNA interference treatment combined with a spindle assembly checkpoint inhibitor delays cells at cytokinesis. Importantly, depletion of either Nek6 or Nek7 leads to defective mitotic progression, indicating that although highly similar, they are not redundant. Indeed, while both kinases localize to spindle poles, only Nek6 obviously localizes to spindle microtubules in metaphase and anaphase and to the midbody during cytokinesis. Together, these data lead us to propose that Nek6 and Nek7 play independent roles not only in robust mitotic spindle formation but also potentially in cytokinesis.",

After CBP80/20-dependent translation, CBP80/20 is replaced by cytoplasmic cap-binding protein eIF4E, which directs steady-state translation. Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), one of the best-characterized mRNA surveillance mechanisms, has been shown to occur on CBP80/20-bound mRNAs. However, despite the tight link between CBP80/20-dependent translation and NMD, the underlying molecular mechanism and cellular factors that mediate CBP80/20-dependent translation remain obscure. Here, we identify a new MIF4G domain-containing protein, CTIF (CBP80/20-dependent translation initiation factor). CTIF interacts directly with CBP80 and is part of the CBP80/20-dependent translation initiation complex. Depletion of endogenous CTIF from an in vitro translation system selectively blocks the translation of CBP80-bound mRNAs, while addition of purified CTIF restores it. Accordingly, down-regulation of endogenous CTIF abrogates NMD. Confocal microscopy shows that CTIF is localized to the perinuclear region. Our observations demonstrate the existence of CBP80/20-dependent translation and support the idea that CBP80/20-dependent translation is mechanistically different from steady-state translation through identification of a specific cellular protein, CTIF.",

We present the genomic structure of DMRT2, showing that it generates several transcripts with distinct coding potential.

Finally, a stop codon-containing exon (exon 4) can be skipped by alternative splicing and can generate a transcript that is predicted to encode a fusion protein. The latter shares 58% amino acid identity with a gene recently described in fish, termed terra. Differences in expression pattern exist for DMRT2 mRNA isoforms among the human adult tissues tested, between adult tissues and human embryos, and between DMRT2 and DMRT1 during embryonic development. We failed to detect mutations by sequencing of DMRT2 in a sample of 46,XY female patients. The interesting structure of DMRT2 coupled to preliminary functional studies in fish showing that terra is involved in somitogenesis suggests that validation or exclusion of this gene as a cause of sex reversal will require more in-depth investigations.",

Mutation of mouse NPP1 in some of its predicted metal-coordinating residues (D358N or H362Q) or in the catalytic site threonine (T238S) resulted in an enzyme that could still form the nucleotidylated catalytic intermediate but was hampered in the second step of catalysis. We also obtained data indicating that the ability of some mammalian NPPs to auto(de)phosphorylate is due to an intrinsic phosphatase activity, whereby the enzyme phosphorylated on Thr-238 represents the covalent intermediate of the phosphatase reaction.

The \"classic\" biosynthetic pathway from cholesterol to testosterone in the testis and the subsequent conversion of testosterone to DHT in genital skin is well established. Recently, an alternative pathway leading to DHT has been described in marsupials, but its potential importance to human development is unclear. AKR1C2 is an enzyme that participates in the alternative but not the classic pathway. Using a candidate gene approach, we identified AKR1C2 mutations with sex-limited recessive inheritance in four 46,XY individuals with disordered sexual development (DSD). Analysis of the inheritance of microsatellite markers excluded other candidate loci. Affected individuals had moderate to severe undervirilization at birth; when recreated by site-directed mutagenesis and expressed in bacteria, the mutant AKR1C2 had diminished but not absent catalytic activities. The 46,XY DSD individuals also carry a mutation causing aberrant splicing in AKR1C4, which encodes an enzyme with similar activity. This suggests a mode of inheritance where the severity of the developmental defect depends on the number of mutations in the two genes. An unrelated 46,XY DSD patient carried AKR1C2 mutations on both alleles, confirming the essential role of AKR1C2 and corroborating the hypothesis that both the classic and alternative pathways of testicular androgen biosynthesis are needed for normal human male sexual differentiation.",

The protein level and transcriptional activity of the Notch1 intracellular domain (Notch1-IC) were higher in SGK1-deficient cells than in SGK1 wild-type cells. Notch1-IC was able to form a trimeric complex with Fbw7 and SGK1, thereby SGK1 enhanced the protein degradation of Notch1-IC via a Fbw7-dependent proteasomal pathway. Furthermore, activated SGK1 phosphorylated Fbw7 at serine 227, an effect inducing Notch1-IC protein degradation and ubiquitylation. Moreover, accumulated dexamethasone-induced SGK1 facilitated the degradation of Notch1-IC through phosphorylation of Fbw7. Together our results suggest that SGK1 inhibits the Notch1 signaling pathway via phosphorylation of Fbw7.",

In CID-MS(2), Hex(5)HexNAc(4)-N-Asn and HexHexNAc-O-Ser/Thr were typically observed, in agreement with known N-linked biantennary complex-type and O-linked core 1-like structures, respectively. Additional glycoforms for specific N- and O-linked glycopeptides were also identified, e.g. tetra-antennary N-glycans and fucosylated core 2-like O-glycans. Subsequent CID-MS(3), of selected fragment-ions from the CID-MS(2) analysis, generated peptide specific b- and y-ions that were used for peptide identification. In total, 58 N- and 63 O-linked glycopeptides from 53 glycoproteins were characterized with respect to glycan- and peptide sequences. The combination of CID and electron capture dissociation techniques allowed for the exact identification of Ser/Thr attachment site(s) for 40 of 57 putative O-glycosylation sites. We defined 29 O-glycosylation sites which have, to our knowledge, not been previously reported. This is the first study of human urinary glycoproteins where \"intact\" glycopeptides were studied, i.e. the presence of glycans and their attachment sites were proven without doubt.",

An Alu repeat sequence containing an ER-dependent transcription enhancer exists between -1416 and -1703. The full-length 5'-flanking sequence of ERbeta fused to a luciferase reporter exhibited functional promoter activity in ERbeta-positive TSUPr1 cell, but not in ERbeta-negative DU145 cells. In addition, DNase I protection assays of the proximal promoter showed unique protection patterns with nuclear extracts from TSUPr1 cells and ERbeta negative HeLa cells, suggesting presence of cell-specific trans-acting factors that mediate tissue/cell-specific ERbeta expression.

        "abstracttext": "PMEPA1 was originally identified as a highly androgen-induced gene by serial analysis of gene expression in androgen-treated LNCaP prostate cancer (CaP) cells. PMEPA1 expression is prostate abundant and restricted to prostatic epithelial cells. PMEPA1-encoded protein shows high sequence homology to a mouse N4wbp4-encoded protein that binds to Nedd4 protein, an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase involved in ubiquitin-dependent, proteasome-mediated protein degradation. Studies from our and other laboratories have suggested the role of PMEPA1 in cell growth regulation as noted by androgen induction of PMEPA1 expression, elevated PMEPA1 expression in nontumorigenic revertants of tumor cell lines after chromosome 8p transfer, and PMEPA1 expression alterations (up- or down-regulation) in human tumors. Here, we demonstrate that PMEPA1 protein through its PY motifs interacts with WW domains of the human NEDD4 protein. Exogenous expression of PMEPA1, in widely used CaP cell lines DU145, PC3, LNCaP, and LNCaP sublines (C4, C4-2, and C4-2B), conferred cell growth inhibition, and at least one of the PY motifs of PMEPA1 may be involved in its cell growth inhibitory functions. Quantitative expression analysis of PMEPA1 in paired normal and tumor cells of 62 patients with primary CaP revealed tumor cells associated decreased expression in 40 of 62 patients that were significantly associated with higher pathologic stage and serum prostate-specific antigen. Taken together, PMEPA1 negatively regulates growth of androgen responsive or refractory CaP cells, and these functions may be mediated through the interaction of PMEPA1 with the NEDD4 protein involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Loss or reduced PMEPA1 expression in CaP further suggests for its role in prostate tumorigenesis.",

However, others found that PKC increased arginine transport in various mammalian cell types, suggesting that the expression of different arginine transporters might be responsible for the opposite PKC effects. We thus investigated the consequence of PKC activation by phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) in various human cell lines expressing leucine-insensitive system y(+) [hCAT-1, hCAT-2B (SLC7A2), or hCAT-3] as well as leucine-sensitive system y(+)L [y(+)LAT1 (SLC7A7) or y(+)LAT2 (SLC7A6)] arginine transporters. PMA reduced system y(+) activity in all cell lines tested, independent of the hCAT isoform expressed, while mRNAs encoding the individual hCAT isoforms were either unchanged or increased. System y(+)L activity was also inhibited by PMA. The extent and onset of inhibition varied between cell lines; however, a PMA-induced increase in arginine transport was never observed. In addition, when expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, y(+)LAT1 and y(+)LAT2 activity was reduced by PMA, and this inhibition could be prevented by the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I. In ECV304 cells, PMA-induced inhibition of systems y(+) and y(+)L could be prevented by G\u00f66976, a specific inhibitor of conventional PKCs. Thymelea toxin, which activates preferentially classical PKC, had a similar inhibitory effect as PMA. In contrast, phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate-dipalmitoyl, an activator of atypical PKC, had no effect.

        "abstracttext": "Oncogenesis in breast cancer often requires the overexpression of the nuclear receptor coactivator AIB1/SRC-3 acting in conjunction with estrogen receptor-alpha (ERalpha). Phosphorylation of both ERalpha and AIB1 has been shown to have profound effects on their functions. In addition, proteasome-mediated degradation plays a major role by regulating their stability and activity. CK1delta, a member of the ubiquitous casein kinase-1 family, is implicated in the progression of breast cancer. In this study, we show that both ERalpha and AIB1 are substrates for CK1delta in vitro, and identify a novel AIB1 phosphorylation site (S601) targeted by CK1delta, significant for the co-activator function of AIB1. CK1delta is able to interact with ERalpha and AIB1 in vivo, while overexpression of CK1delta in breast cancer cells results in an increased association of ERalpha with AIB1 as confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation assays from cell lysates. Using an siRNA-based approach, luciferase reporter assays and qRT-PCR, we observe that silencing of CK1delta leads to reduced ERalpha transcriptional activity, despite increased ERalpha levels, similarly to proteasome inhibition. We provide evidence that AIB1 protein levels are reduced by CK1delta silencing, in an estradiol-dependent manner; such destabilization can be inhibited by pre-treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132. We propose that differing activities adopted by ERalpha and AIB1 as a consequence of their interactions with and phosphorylation by CK1delta, particularly AIB1 stabilization, influence the transcriptional activity of ERalpha, and therefore have a role in breast cancer development.",

Among the >15 genes implicated in these conditions, mutations in FGF8 and FGFR1 account for ~12% of cases; notably, KAL1 and HS6ST1 are also involved in FGFR1 signaling and can be mutated in CHH. We therefore hypothesized that mutations in genes encoding a broader range of modulators of the FGFR1 pathway might contribute to the genetics of CHH as causal or modifier mutations. Thus, we aimed to (1) investigate whether CHH individuals harbor mutations in members of the so-called \"FGF8 synexpression\" group and (2) validate the ability of a bioinformatics algorithm on the basis of protein-protein interactome data (interactome-based affiliation scoring [IBAS]) to identify high-quality candidate genes. On the basis of sequence homology, expression, and structural and functional data, seven genes were selected and sequenced in 386 unrelated CHH individuals and 155 controls. Except for FGF18 and SPRY2, all other genes were found to be mutated in CHH individuals: FGF17 (n = 3 individuals), IL17RD (n = 8), DUSP6 (n = 5), SPRY4 (n = 14), and FLRT3 (n = 3). Independently, IBAS predicted FGF17 and IL17RD as the two top candidates in the entire proteome on the basis of a statistical test of their protein-protein interaction patterns to proteins known to be altered in CHH. Most of the FGF17 and IL17RD mutations altered protein function in vitro. IL17RD mutations were found only in KS individuals and were strongly linked to hearing loss (6/8 individuals). Mutations in genes encoding components of the FGF pathway are associated with complex modes of CHH inheritance and act primarily as contributors to an oligogenic genetic architecture underlying CHH.",

This study aimed to decipher the yet unclear mechanisms involved in this differential cell sensitivity, with particular attention to the specific influence that cell differentiation may have on these processes. Hence, we comparatively evaluated the permissiveness of cells to either ERalpha AFs in two different cases: (i) a series of cell lines originating from a common tissue, but with distinct differentiation phenotypes; and (ii) cell lines that undergo differentiation processes in culture. These experiments demonstrate that the respective contribution that AF-1 and AF-2 make toward ERalpha activity varies in a cell differentiation stage-dependent manner. Specifically, whereas AF-1 is the dominant AF involved in ERalpha transcriptional activity in differentiated cells, the more a cell is de-differentiated the more this cell mediates ERalpha signaling through AF-2. For instance, AF-2 is the only active AF in cells that have achieved their epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Moreover, the stable expression of a functional ERalpha in strictly AF-2 permissive cells restores an AF-1-sensitive cell context. These results, together with data obtained in different ERalpha-positive cell lines tested strongly suggest that the transcriptional activity of ERalpha relies on its AF-1 in most estrogen target cell types.",

It is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum as a transmembrane glycosylated precursor that migrates with an apparent molecular mass of about 600 kd on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After it reaches the Golgi complex, the protein is cleaved to generate two subunits with apparent molecular masses of approximately 515 and 85 kd respectively. The larger NH2-terminal alpha-subunit lacks a membrane-spanning region. It remains attached to the membrane through noncovalent association with the smaller COOH-terminal beta-subunit. Proteolysis occurs at the sequence RHRR, which resembles the sequence RKRR at the proteolytic site in the receptors for insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), the only other cell surface receptors known to undergo proteolytic processing. Proteolysis of LRP occurs coincident with the conversion of the N-linked carbohydrates to the mature endoglycosidase H-resistant, neuraminidase-sensitive form. Proteolysis is prevented by brefeldin A, which blocks transport to the Golgi complex. These data raise the possibility that LRP and the receptors for insulin and IGF-1 are processed by a specific endoprotease that recognizes protein with extended basic sequences and resides in the trans-Golgi complex or in post-Golgi vesicles of the constitutive secretory pathway.",

As protein kinases reside at the nodes of phosphorylation-based signal transmission, comprehensive analysis of their cellular expression and site-specific phosphorylation can provide important insights into the architecture and functionality of signaling networks. However, in global proteome studies, low cellular abundance of protein kinases often results in rather minor peptide species that are occluded by a vast excess of peptides from other cellular proteins. These analytical limitations create a rationale for kinome-wide enrichment of protein kinases prior to mass spectrometry analysis. Here, we employed stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) to compare the binding characteristics of three kinase-selective affinity resins by quantitative mass spectrometry. The evaluated pre-fractionation tools possessed pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine-based kinase inhibitors as immobilized capture ligands and retained considerable subsets of the human kinome. Based on these results, an affinity resin displaying the broadly selective kinase ligand VI16832 was employed to quantify the relative expression of more than 170 protein kinases across three different, SILAC-encoded cancer cell lines. These experiments demonstrated the feasibility of comparative kinome profiling in a compact experimental format. Interestingly, we found high levels of cytoplasmic and low levels of receptor tyrosine kinases in MV4-11 leukemia cells compared with the adherent cancer lines HCT116 and MDA-MB-435S. The VI16832 resin was further exploited to pre-fractionate kinases for targeted phosphoproteomics analysis, which revealed about 1200 distinct phosphorylation sites on more than 200 protein kinases. This hitherto largest survey of site-specific phosphorylation across the kinome significantly expands the basis for functional follow-up studies on protein kinase regulation.

The deduced amino acid sequences of human alpha 1- and beta 2-syntrophin are nearly identical to their homologues in mouse, suggesting a strong functional conservation among the individual isoforms, Much like beta 1-syntrophin, human beta 2-syntrophin has multiple transcript classes and is expressed widely, although in a distinct pattern of relative abundance. In contrast, human alpha 1-syntrophin is most abundant in heart and skeletal muscle, and less so in other tissues. Somatic cell hybrids and fluorescent in situ hybridization were both used to determine their chromosomal locations: beta 2-syntrophin to chromosome 16q22-23 and alpha 1-syntrophin to chromosome 20q11.2. Finally, we used in vitro translated proteins in an immunoprecipitation assay to show that, like beta 1-syntrophin, both beta 2- and alpha 1-syntrophin interact with peptides encoding the syntrophin-binding region of dystrophin, utrophin/dystrophin related protein, and the Torpedo 87K protein.",

These genes encode two similar but distinct cell surface receptors comprised of an extracellular domain with three immunoglobulin-like regions, a single transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic portion containing a tyrosine kinase domain with a typical kinase insert. The expression of these two cDNAs in transfected NIH 3T3 cells led to the biosynthesis of proteins of 150 kd and 135 kd for flg and bek, respectively. Direct binding experiments with radiolabeled acidic FGF (aFGF) or basic FGF (bFGF), inhibition of binding with native growth factors, and Scatchard analysis of the binding data indicated that bek and flg bind either aFGF or bFGF with dissociation constants of (2-15) x 10(-11) M.

The type III procollagen was unusually sensitive to proteinases and cleaved by trypsin into a three-quarter fragment at 0 degrees C. Here we demonstrate that the mutation in the type III procollagen gene is a single base mutation that converts the codon for glycine at amino acid 790 of the alpha 1(III) chain to a codon for serine. The mutation probably makes the procollagen molecule unusually sensitive to proteases because it causes local unfolding of the triple helix and exposes the adjacent arginine residue.

Type III collagen produced by these cells contained normal and abnormal alpha-chains and cyanogen bromide peptides. The site of the structural defect in the abnormal alpha 1 (III) chains was localized to the region of Met797, which is at the junction of the two carboxyl-terminal CB5 and CB9 cyanogen bromide peptides. Chemical cleavage of heteroduplexes formed between EDS-IV mRNA and a normal cDNA clone covering the CB5 and CB9 region showed that about 100 nucleotides were mismatched. Sequencing of amplified and cloned cDNA spanning the mutant region revealed a 108 nucleotide deletion corresponding to amino acid residues Gly775 to Lys810. The deleted nucleotide sequence corresponded to sequences that, by analogy to the organization of the type I collagen genes, should be precisely encoded by exon 41 of the COL3A1 gene. Sequencing of amplified genomic DNA, prepared using disimilar amounts of primers specific for exons 41 and 42, displayed a base substitution (G-to-A) in the highly conserved GT dinucleotide of the 5' splice site of intron 41. Normal sequences were also obtained from the normal allele. It is likely that the GT-to-AT transition at the splice donor site of intron 41 generated an abnormally spliced mRNA in which sequences of exon 40 and 42 were joined together with maintenance of the reading frame. The corresponding peptide deletion included the cyanogen bromide cleavage site Met797-Pro798 and the mammalian collagenase cleavage site at Gly781-Ile782. These losses account for the resistance of EDS-IV collagen to cyanogen bromide and mammalian collagenase digestion. Cultured fibroblasts produced normal homotrimer, mutant homotrimer, and mixed heterotrimer type III collagen molecules.

In this study, we found that ERp44, an ER lumenal protein of the thioredoxin family, directly interacts with the third lumenal loop of IP(3)R type 1 (IP(3)R1) and that the interaction is dependent on pH, Ca(2+) concentration, and redox state: the presence of free cysteine residues in the loop is required. Ca(2+)-imaging experiments and single-channel recording of IP(3)R1 activity with a planar lipid bilayer system demonstrated that IP(3)R1 is directly inhibited by ERp44. Thus, ERp44 senses the environment in the ER lumen and modulates IP(3)R1 activity accordingly, which should in turn contribute to regulating both intralumenal conditions and the complex patterns of cytosolic Ca(2+) concentrations.",

Using a yeast three-hybrid assay we demonstrate that several of the human vRNAs interact in a sequence-specific manner with TEP1. The presence of 16 WD40 repeats in the carboxyl terminus of the TEP1 protein is a convenient number for this protein to serve a structural or organizing role in the vault, a particle with eight-fold symmetry.

        "abstracttext": "We have characterized a human estrogen receptor (ER) mutant, V364E, which has a single amino acid substitution in its hormone-binding domain. This ER mutant is fully active or even superactive at saturating levels of estradiol (10(-8) M E2) yet has the capacity to act as a strong dominant negative inhibitor of the wild type ER. In transient transfection assays using ER-negative Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and two different estrogen response element (ERE)-containing promoter reporter genes, V364E treated with 10(-8) M E2 exhibited approximately 250% and 100% of the activity of the wild type ER with these two promoter contexts, respectively. Despite the high activity of V364E when present alone in cells, coexpression of both V364E and wild type ER causes a significant decrease in overall ER-mediated transcriptional activity. On the TATA promoter, where V364E was more inhibitory, estrogen-stimulated activity was reduced by approximately 50% at a 1:1 ratio of mutant to wild type ER expression vector, and at a 10:1 ratio, 75% of ER activity was inhibited. V364E was expressed at lower levels than wild type ER and has a approximately 40-fold lower affinity for E2 compared with wild type ER. In promoter interference assays, V364E exhibited a strict dependence upon E2 for binding to an ERE. Surprisingly, even when V364E was unable to bind to ERE DNA (i.e. either at low E2 concentration or by mutation of its DNA-binding domain), this mutant retained full dominant negative activity. This highly active ER mutant is, thus, able to repress ER-mediated transcription when the mutant and wild type ER are present together in cells, even without DNA binding. Since competition for ERE binding and the formation of inactive heterodimers cannot fully account for the dominant negative activity of V364E, it is probable that altered interactions with proteins important in ER-mediated transcription play a key role in the repression of transcription by V364E. The properties and probable mechanism of action of V364E distinguish it from other previously described dominant negative inhibitors, in which competition for cis-acting DNA elements by transcriptionally inactive receptors played a large role in the resultant dominant negative phenotype.",

Cultured dermal fibroblasts produced normal and shortened alpha 1(III) chains. The triple helix of the latter chain was shortened owing to a 33 amino acid deletion of Gly-184 to Pro-216. The corresponding region of cDNA lacked 99 base pairs from nucleotides 1051 to 1149. The deletions corresponded exactly to the normal sequence encoded by exon 17 of the COL3A1 gene. The proband was heterozygous for a T to G transversion at position +2 of intron 17, which resulted in skipping of exon 17. The splicing defect was not corrected by growing the fibroblasts at 33 degrees C and no other splicing variants were identified at 33 or 37 degrees C. The affected brother had the same mutation but his unaffected mother did not. Heterotrimeric type III collagen molecules containing normal and mutant chains were retained within the cell. The mutant homotrimeric molecules were modified and secreted normally and were thermally stable. These normal characteristics of the mutant homotrimers suggested that the loss of ten Gly-Xaa-Yaa triplets (where Gly-Xaa-Yaa is a repetitive amino acid triplet structure in which Xaa and Yaa are other amino acids, proline and hydroxyproline being more common in the Yaa position) did not adversely affect the formation and stability of the triple helix or the structural requirements for secretion. However, the mutant homotrimers were not incorporated into the extracellular matrix of an in vitro model of EDS-IV dermis. The EDS-IV phenotype in this family was probably due to a deficiency in the amount of normal type III collagen available for formation of the heterotypic collagen fibrils of the extracellular matrix. Intracellular and extracellular quality-control mechanisms prevented the incorporation of heterotrimeric and homotrimeric mutant type III collagen molecules into the cross-linked extracellular matrix.",

        "abstracttext": "Bone metabolism is regulated by a balance between bone resorption caused by osteoclasts and bone formation caused by osteoblasts. This balance is disturbed in postmenopausal women as a result of lower serum estrogen levels. Estrogen, which is used in hormone replacement therapy to prevent postmenopausal osteoporosis, downregulates expression of the interleukin 6 (IL-6) gene in osteoblasts and bone marrow stromal cells. IL-6 is directly involved in bone resorption by activating immature osteoclasts. We show here that NF-kappa B and C/EBP beta are important regulators of IL-6 gene expression in human osteoblasts. Importantly, the IL-6 promoter is inhibited by estrogen in the absence of a functional estrogen receptor (ER) binding site. This inhibition is mediated by the transcription factors NF-kappa B and C/EBP beta. Evidence is presented for a direct interaction between these two factors and ER. We characterized the protein sequence requirements for this association in vitro and in vivo. The physical and functional interaction depends in part on the DNA binding domain and region D of ER and on the Rel homology domain of NF-kappa B and the bZIP region of C/EBP beta. The cross-coupling between ER, NF-kappa B, and C/EBP beta also results in reduced activity of promoters with ER binding sites. We further show that the mechanism of IL-6 gene repression by estrogen is clearly different from that of activation of promoters with ER binding sites. Therefore, drugs that separate the transactivation and transrepression functions of ER will be very helpful for treatment of osteoporosis without causing undesirable side effects.",

The ERbetacx transcript is expressed in testis, ovary, thymus and prostate as well as in human cultured cell lines such as HEC-1, HOS-TE85 and Saos-2 cells. ERbetacx protein is also immunodetectable in these human cells. Biochemical analysis reveals that the average dissociation constants ( K d) of ERalpha and ERbeta for 17beta-estradiol (E2) are 0.2 and 0.6 nM respectively, but ERbetacx has no ligand binding ability. ERalpha and ERbeta proteins bind to the estrogen response element, whereas ERbetacx does not form any shifted complex in gel shift assays. In a transient expression assay, ERbetacx shows no ligand-dependent transactivation ability of a basal promoter and also cannot interact with a cofactor, TIF1alpha, in the presence or absence of E2. ERbetacx preferentially forms a heterodimer with ERalpha rather than that with ERbeta, inhibiting DNA binding by ERalpha. Interestingly, however, it shows a significant dominant negative activity only against ERalpha transactivation. Thus, this study indicates that ERbetacx potentially inhibits ERalpha-mediated estrogen action and that alternative splicing of the C-terminal region and its inhibitory properties are characteristic of several members of nuclear receptor isoforms.",

Furthermore, a gene expression signature containing common targets for ER and NF\u03baB has been identified and found to be associated with the more aggressive luminal B intrinsic subtype of ER-positive breast tumors. Here, we describe a novel mechanism by which ER and NF\u03baB cooperate to up-regulate expression of one important gene from this signature, ABCG2, which encodes a transporter protein associated with the development of drug-resistant breast cancer. We and others have confirmed that this gene is regulated primarily by estrogen in an ER- and estrogen response element (ERE)-dependent manner. We found that whereas proinflammatory cytokines have little effect on this gene in the absence of 17\u03b2-estradiol, they can potentiate ER activity in an NF\u03baB-dependent manner. ER allows the NF\u03baB family member p65 to access a latent NF\u03baB response element located near the ERE in the gene promoter. NF\u03baB recruitment to the gene is, in turn, required to stabilize ER occupancy at the functional ERE. The result of this cooperative binding of ER and p65 at adjacent response elements leads to a major increase in both ABCG2 mRNA and protein expression. These findings indicate that estrogen and inflammatory factors can modify each other's activity through modulation of transcription factor accessibility and/or occupancy at adjacent response elements. This novel transcriptional mechanism could have important implications in breast cancer, where both inflammation and estrogen can promote cancer progression.",

Recent studies have shown a role for ERalpha-interacting membranous and cytosolic proteins in ERalpha action, but our understanding of the role of the microtubule network in the modulation of ERalpha signaling remains unclear. Here we found that endogenous ERalpha associates with microtubules through the microtubule-binding protein hematopoietic PBX-interaction protein (HPIP). Biochemical and RNA-interference studies demonstrated that HPIP influences ERalpha-dependent rapid estrogen signaling by acting as a scaffold protein and recruits Src kinase and the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to a complex with ERalpha, which in turn stimulates AKT and MAPK. We also found that ERalpha interacts with beta-tubulin through HPIP. Destabilization of microtubules activated ERalpha signaling, whereas stabilization of microtubules repressed ERalpha transcriptional activity in a HPIP-dependent manner. These findings revealed a role for HPIP-microtubule complex in regulating 17beta-estradiol-ERalpha responses in mammalian cells and discovered an inherent role of microtubules in the action of nuclear receptor.",

        "abstracttext": "SH2D4A, comprising a single SH2 domain, is a novel protein of the SH2 signaling protein family. We have previously demonstrated SH2D4A is expressed ubiquitously in various tissues and is located in the cytoplasm. In this study we investigated the function of SH2D4A in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells using interaction analysis, cell proliferation assays, and kinase activity detection. SH2D4A was found to directly bind to estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha), and prevent the recruitment of phospholipase C-gamma (PLC-gamma) to ERalpha. Moreover, we observed its inhibitory effects on estrogen-induced cell proliferation, involving the protein kinase C (PKC) signaling pathway. Together, these findings suggested that SH2D4A inhibited cell proliferation by suppression of the ERalpha/PLC-gamma/PKC signaling pathway. SH2D4A may be useful for the development of a new anti-cancer drug acting as an ER signaling modulator.",

The cDNA clones were isolated from size-fractionated cDNA libraries derived from human fetal brain, adult whole brain and amygdala, and their protein-coding sequences were predicted. Thirty-seven cDNA clones entirely sequenced in this study were selected as cDNAs which have coding potentiality by in vitro transcription/translation experiments, and the remaining 23 cDNA clones were chosen by computer-assisted analysis of terminal sequences of cDNAs. The average sizes of the inserts and corresponding open reading frames of cDNA clones analyzed here were 4.5 kb and 2.2 kb (733 amino acid residues), respectively. Sequence analyses against the public databases enabled us to annotate the functions of the predicted products of the 25 genes; 84% of these predicted gene products (21 gene products) were classified into proteins related to cell signaling/communication, nucleic acid management, and cell structure/motility. In addition to the sequence information about these 60 genes, their expression profiles were also studied in some human tissues including brain regions by reverse transcription-coupled polymerase chain reaction, products of which were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.",

Classic ER binding to DNA is not required and the mechanism of repression is unclear. Previously reported studies suggest that the interference of NF-kappaB binding to DNA by ER may play an important role. An alternative model for repression would be the disruption of NF-kappaB transactivation. In the present study, gel shift assays were used to examine the binding of RelA and p50 dimers to the IL-6 promoter in the presence of ER. The effect of ER on NF-kappaB transactivation was studied independent of NF-kappaB binding to DNA using the mammalian one-hybrid system. ER had little effect on the binding of homodimers or heterodimers of RelA and p50 to the IL-6 promoter. In transfection experiments, both ERalpha and ERbeta inhibited NF-kappaB-mediated expression in a hormone dependent manner with repression also dependent upon dimerization of RelA with p50. Mutant ER that is unable to transactivate failed to repress NF-kappaB expression, but deletion of the N-terminal portion of the receptor had no effect. Taken together, these results suggest that the disruption of NF-kappaB-mediated transactivation plays a significant role in ER inhibition of IL-6 gene expression.",

No transcript contains both exons 3 and 4. No evidence for expression of exons 1 and 2 could be discerned.

        "abstracttext": "Deregulated signaling of ErbB2 receptor tyrosine kinase is often associated with hormone resistance in estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha)-positive breast cancers, establishing a relationship between ErbB2 and ERalpha pathways. Although ERalpha and ERbeta are expressed in many breast cancer cells, the response of ERbeta to ErbB2 signaling is less well defined. In the present study, we demonstrate that ERbeta activity can be modulated by ErbB2 signaling in ER-expressing breast cancer cells. The estrogen-dependent transcriptional activity of ERbeta was altered in a manner similar to ERalpha by either activation of ErbB2/ErbB3 signaling by growth factor heregulin beta or expression of a constitutively active mutant of ErbB2. However, as opposed to ERalpha, the p38 MAPK pathway was found to be involved in liganded ERbeta repression activity by ErbB2 signaling and in regulating estrogen-responsive promoter occupancy by ERbeta. The repression in ERbeta response to hormone was dependent upon its AF-1 domain which includes serines 106 and 124, two phosphorylation target sites for Erk that we previously showed to be involved in SRC-1 recruitment to ERbeta. Substitution of these two serines by aspartic acid residues abolished the repression of ERbeta by activated ErbB2/ErbB3. Moreover, expression of SRC-1 also relieved the inhibition of ERbeta in heregulin-treated cells. Our study demonstrates a functional coupling between ERbeta and ErbB receptors and outlines the differential role of the AF-1 region in the regulation of the estrogen-dependent cell growth and activity of both estrogen receptors in response to growth factor signaling.",

Here, we describe an approach for broad analysis of human plasma N-glycoproteins using a combination of immunoaffinity subtraction and glycoprotein capture to reduce both the protein concentration range and the overall sample complexity. Six high-abundance plasma proteins were simultaneously removed using a pre-packed, immobilized antibody column. N-linked glycoproteins were then captured from the depleted plasma using hydrazide resin and enzymatically digested, and the bound N-linked glycopeptides were released using peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F). Following strong cation exchange (SCX) fractionation, the deglycosylated peptides were analyzed by reversed-phase capillary liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Using stringent criteria, a total of 2053 different N-glycopeptides were confidently identified, covering 303 nonredundant N-glycoproteins. This enrichment strategy significantly improved detection and enabled identification of a number of low-abundance proteins, exemplified by interleukin-1 receptor antagonist protein (approximately 200 pg/mL), cathepsin L (approximately 1 ng/mL), and transforming growth factor beta 1 (approximately 2 ng/mL).

We note that Eos contains a related motif PEDLA, and we demonstrate that CtBP can bind this site weakly but that it also contacts additional regions of Eos. Consistent with this finding, mutation of the PEDLA motif does not negate CtBP binding or CtBP-mediated repression by Eos. CtBP has previously been shown to bind to a PXDLS-type motif in Ikaros, and we show that another Ikaros-related protein TRPS1 also contains a PXDLS CtBP contact motif within its repression domain.

It was proposed that the sex reversal may arise by haploinsufficiency for a gene localized to the minimum deletion. The 9p24.3 genes DMRT1 and DMRT2 are the favorite TD9 candidates to date, in virtue of their sequence similarity to doublesex and mab-3, sexual regulators in Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans, respectively. The hypothesis of sex reversal by combined haploinsufficiency for the two genes was put forward to explain the lack of mutations in either gene in XY sex-reversed females. Here we describe a XY sex-reversed patient carrying a novel 9p deletion that extends over less than 700 kb of genomic DNA. This region defines the smallest interval for sex reversal found to date. DMRT1 and DMRT2 map outside this region. Our data do not support the hypothesis of combined haploinsufficiency for DMRT1 and DMRT2. Nevertheless, DMRT1 localizes very close to the deletion breakpoint and has a pattern of expression compatible with a role in sex determination. It therefore remains a candidate gene for 9p sex reversal.",

        "abstracttext": "Mammary oncogenesis is profoundly influenced by signaling pathways controlled by estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha). Although it is known that ERalpha exerts its oncogenic effect by stimulating the proliferation of many human breast cancers through the activation of target genes, our knowledge of the underlying transcriptional mechanisms remains limited. Our published work has shown that the in vivo activity of LIM homeodomain transcription factors (LIM-HD) is critically regulated by cofactors of LIM-HD proteins (CLIM) and the ubiquitin ligase RING finger LIM domain-interacting protein (RLIM). Here, we identify CLIM and RLIM as novel ERalpha cofactors that colocalize and interact with ERalpha in primary human breast tumors. We show that both cofactors associate with estrogen-responsive promoters and regulate the expression of endogenous ERalpha target genes in breast cancer cells. Surprisingly, our results indicate opposing functions of LIM cofactors for ERalpha and LIM-HDs: whereas CLIM enhances transcriptional activity of LIM-HDs, it inhibits transcriptional activation mediated by ERalpha on most target genes in vivo. In turn, the ubiquitin ligase RLIM inhibits transcriptional activity of LIM-HDs but enhances transcriptional activation of endogenous ERalpha target genes. Results from a human breast cancer tissue microarray of 1,335 patients revealed a highly significant correlation of elevated CLIM levels to ER/progesterone receptor positivity and poor differentiation of tumors. Combined, these results indicate that LIM cofactors CLIM and RLIM regulate the biological activity of ERalpha during the development of human breast cancer.",

With the use of ecliptic pHluorin-fused ER46, total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy in live human endothelial cells illustrates that ER46 can topologically conform to a type I transmembrane protein structure. Mutation of isoleucine-386 at the center of ER46's transmembrane hydrophobic core prevents membrane spanning, obscures the N-terminal ectodomain, and effects a marked reduction in membrane-impermeant estrogen binding with diminished rapid eNOS activation and NO production, despite maintained genomic induction of an estrogen response element-luciferase reporter.

The full-length cDNA (4839 bp) encompassed the recently reported androgen-regulated prostatic cDNA PMEPA1, and so we refer to this gene as STAG1/PMEPA1. Two STAG1/PMEPA1 mRNA transcripts of approximately 2.7 and 5 kb, with identical coding regions but variant 3' untranslated regions, were predominantly expressed in normal prostate tissue and at lower levels in the ovary. The expression of this gene was upregulated in 87% of RCC samples and also was upregulated in stomach and rectal adenocarcinomas. In contrast, STAG1/PMEPA1 expression was barely detectable in leukemia and lymphoma samples. Analysis of expressed sequence tag databases showed that STAG1/PMEPA1 also was expressed in pancreatic, endometrial, and prostatic adenocarcinomas. The STAG1/PMEPA1 cDNA encodes a 287-amino-acid protein containing a putative transmembrane domain and motifs that suggest that it may bind src homology 3- and tryptophan tryptophan domain-containing proteins. This protein shows 67% identity to the protein encoded by the chromosome 18 open reading frame 1 gene. Translation of STAG1/PMEPA1 mRNA in vitro showed two products of 36 and 39 kDa, respectively, suggesting that translation may initiate at more than one site. Comparison to genomic clones showed that STAG1/PMEPA1 was located on chromosome 20q13 between microsatellite markers D20S183 and D20S173 and spanned four exons and three introns.

        "abstracttext": "Transcriptional activation by the estrogen receptor (NR3A1, or ER) requires specific ligand-inducible activation functions located in the amino (AF-1) and the carboxyl (AF-2 and AF-2a) regions of the protein. Although several detailed reports of ER structure and function describe mechanisms whereby AF-2 activates transcription, less precise data exist for AF-1. We recently reported that the rainbow trout and human estrogen receptors (rtERs and hERs, respectively), two evolutionary distant proteins, exhibit comparable AF-1 activities while sharing only 20% homology in their N-terminal region. These data suggested that the basic mechanisms whereby AF-1 and the ER N-terminal region activate transactivation might be evolutionary conserved. Therefore, a comparative approach between rtER and hER could provide more detailed information on AF-1 function. Transactivation analysis of truncated receptors and Gal4DBD (DNA binding domain of the Gal4 factor) fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae defined a minimal region of 11 amino acids, located at the beginning of the B domain, necessary for AF-1 activity in rtER. Hydrophobic cluster analysis (HCA) indicated the presence of a potential alpha-helix within this minimal region that is conserved during evolution. Both rtER and hER sequences corresponding to this potential alpha-helical structure were able to induce transcription when fused to the Gal4DBD, indicating that this region can transactivate in an autonomous manner. Furthermore, point mutations in this 11-amino acid region of the receptors markedly reduced their transcriptional activity either within the context of a whole ER or a Gal4DBD fusion protein. Data were confirmed in mammalian cells and, interestingly, ERs with an inverted alpha-helix were as active as their corresponding wild-type proteins, indicating a conserved role in AF-1 for these structures. Moreover, using two naturally occurring rtER N-terminal variants possessing or not the A domain (rtER(L) and rtER(S), respectively), together with A domain-truncated hER and chimeric rtER/hER receptors, we demonstrated that the A domain of the ER plays an inhibitory role in ligand-independent activity of the receptor. In vitro and in vivo protein-protein interaction assays using both rtER and hER demonstrated that this repression is likely to be mediated by a ligand-sensitive direct interaction between the A domain and the C-terminal region of the ER.",

        "abstracttext": "Cancers arise owing to mutations in a subset of genes that confer growth advantage. The availability of the human genome sequence led us to propose that systematic resequencing of cancer genomes for mutations would lead to the discovery of many additional cancer genes. Here we report more than 1,000 somatic mutations found in 274 megabases (Mb) of DNA corresponding to the coding exons of 518 protein kinase genes in 210 diverse human cancers. There was substantial variation in the number and pattern of mutations in individual cancers reflecting different exposures, DNA repair defects and cellular origins. Most somatic mutations are likely to be 'passengers' that do not contribute to oncogenesis. However, there was evidence for 'driver' mutations contributing to the development of the cancers studied in approximately 120 genes. Systematic sequencing of cancer genomes therefore reveals the evolutionary diversity of cancers and implicates a larger repertoire of cancer genes than previously anticipated.",

        "abstracttext": "Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 23 inhibits renal phosphate reabsorption by activating FGF receptor (FGFR) 1c in a Klotho-dependent fashion. The phosphaturic activity of FGF23 is abrogated by proteolytic cleavage at the RXXR motif that lies at the boundary between the FGF core homology domain and the 72-residue-long C-terminal tail of FGF23. Here, we show that the soluble ectodomains of FGFR1c and Klotho are sufficient to form a ternary complex with FGF23 in vitro. The C-terminal tail of FGF23 mediates binding of FGF23 to a de novo site generated at the composite FGFR1c-Klotho interface. Consistent with this finding, the isolated 72-residue-long C-terminal tail of FGF23 impairs FGF23 signaling by competing with full-length ligand for binding to the binary FGFR-Klotho complex. Injection of the FGF23 C-terminal tail peptide into healthy rats inhibits renal phosphate excretion and induces hyperphosphatemia. In a mouse model of renal phosphate wasting attributable to high FGF23, the FGF23 C-terminal peptide reduces phosphate excretion, leading to an increase in serum phosphate concentration. Our data indicate that proteolytic cleavage at the RXXR motif abrogates FGF23 activity by a dual mechanism: by removing the binding site for the binary FGFR-Klotho complex that resides in the C-terminal region of FGF23, and by generating an endogenous inhibitor of FGF23. We propose that peptides derived from the C-terminal tail of FGF23 or peptidomimetics and small-molecule organomimetics of the C-terminal tail can be used as therapeutics to treat renal phosphate wasting.",

Here, we show evidence that CITED1 functions as a selective coactivator for estrogen-dependent transcription. When transfected, CITED1 enhanced transcriptional activation by the ligand-binding/AF2 domain of both estrogen receptor-alpha (ERalpha) and ERbeta in an estrogen-dependent manner, but it affected transcriptional activities of other nuclear receptors only marginally. CITED1 bound directly to ERalpha in an estrogen-dependent manner through its transactivating domain, and this binding activity was separable from its p300-binding activity. CITED1 was strongly expressed in nulliparous mouse mammary epithelial cells and, when expressed in ER-positive MCF-7 breast cancer cells by transduction, exogenous CITED1 enhanced sensitivity of MCF-7 cells to estrogen, stabilizing the estrogen-dependent interaction between p300 and ERalpha. The estrogen-induced expression of the transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) mRNA transcript was enhanced in the CITED1-expressing MCF-7 cells, whereas estrogen-induced expression of the mRNA transcripts for progesterone receptor or pS2 was not affected. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that endogenous CITED1 is recruited to the chromosomal TGF-alpha promoter in MCF-7 cells in an estrogen-dependent manner but not to the pS2 promoter.

Mechanisms that direct LRP to function in these distinct pathways likely involve its association with distinct cytoplasmic adaptor proteins. We tested the hypothesis that the association of various adaptor proteins with the LRP cytoplasmic domain is modulated by its phosphorylation state. Phosphoamino acid analysis of metabolically labeled LRP revealed that this receptor is phosphorylated at serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues within its cytoplasmic domain, whereas inhibitor studies identified protein kinase Calpha (PKCalpha) as a kinase capable of phosphorylating LRP. Mutational analysis identified critical threonine and serine residues within the LRP cytoplasmic domain that are necessary for phosphorylation mediated by PKCalpha. Mutating these threonine and serine residues to alanines generated a receptor that was not phosphorylated and that was internalized more rapidly than wild-type LRP, revealing that phosphorylation reduces the association of LRP with adaptor molecules of the endocytic machinery. In contrast, serine and threonine phosphorylation was necessary for the interaction of LRP with Shc, an adaptor protein that participates in signaling events. Furthermore, serine and threonine phosphorylation increased the interaction of LRP with other adaptor proteins such as Dab-1 and CED-6/GULP. These results indicate that phosphorylation of LRP by PKCalpha modulates the endocytic and signaling function of LRP by modifying its association with adaptor proteins.",

        "url": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed11682626",
        "abstracttext": "The transcriptional activity of ERalpha (or NR3A1) after binding of ligand is mediated through synergistic action between activation functions (AFs) AF-1 and AF-2 and the transcriptional machinery. This is functionally achieved by bridging coactivators such as CEBP binding protein/p300 and members of the p160 subfamily such as steroid receptor coactivator protein-1 (SRC-1). We previously identified a conserved potential alpha-helical structure within the AF-1 functional core, and by evaluating point mutants of human ERalpha (hERalpha) within this region, we show that in transfection experiments this structure is required for synergism between SRC-1 and hERalpha. We report that the transcriptional synergism between AF-1 mutants and SRC-1 was abolished in AF-1-sensitive cells such as HepG2, whereas it was reduced by 50% in CHO-K1 cells, which have a mixed context that is sensitive to both the AF-1 and AF-2 regions of hERalpha. Glutathione-S-transferase pulldown assays demonstrate that the AF-1 core is able and sufficient for the hERalpha N-terminal region to interact with SRC-1. Interestingly, an enhancement of this recruitment in the presence of the hERalpha ligand-binding domain was observed, which was found to be dependent on a direct interaction between the N-terminal B domain and the ligand-binding domain. Another functional consequence of this physical interaction, which is promoted by both partial and full agonists of hERalpha, was an increase in the phosphorylation state of the N-terminal domain. Binding of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OHT) to the hERalpha C-terminal region induced a functional AF-1 conformation in vitro through this N- and C-terminal interaction. The involvement of an SRC-1-mediated pathway in transactivation mediated by hERalpha AF-1 was further substantiated by transfection experiments using the OHTresponsive human C3 promoter, which showed that OHT-induced hERalpha AF-1 activity was enhanced by SRC-1 and required the AF-1 alpha-helical structure. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the synergism between AF-1 and AF-2 is mediated in part by a cooperative recruitment of SRC-1 by both the AF-1 alpha-helical core and AF-2 regions and that it is stabilized by a direct interaction between the B and C-terminal domains. This interaction of SRC-1 with the AF-1 alpha-helical core is essential for both E2- and OHT-induced ERalpha activity.",

Moreover, promoter-reporter constructs containing this sequence (-108 to -84 or -108 to +23) are also estrogen-responsive. Mutation of the ERE half-site in the Hsp 27-derived oligonucleotides did not result in loss of estrogen responsiveness in transient transfection studies, suggesting that estrogen inducibility was mediated through the Sp1-DNA motif. Gel mobility shift assays using 32P-labeled wild type and ERE mutant Sp1(N)10ERE and consensus Sp1 oligonucleotides showed that Sp1 protein formed a DNA-protein complex with all three nucleotides, and the intensities of retarded bands were enhanced by coincubation with wild type ER and 11C-ER, which does not contain the DNA-binding domain. ER mutants in which N-terminal (19C-ER) and C-terminal (15C-ER) regions were deleted did not enhance Sp1-DNA binding or hormone-induced transactivation of GC-rich promoter-reporter constructs in ER-negative MDA-MB-231 cells, whereas both wild type and 11C-ER restored inducibility. Immunoprecipitation studies also confirmed that the Sp1 and ER proteins physically interact. The interaction of the Sp1 and ER proteins and the resulting enhanced Sp1-DNA binding is observed in the presence or absence of estrogen (hormone-independent), whereas transactivation of promoter-reporter constructs is estrogen-dependent. Thus, the results illustrate a new estrogen-dependent transactivation pathway that involves ER-protein interactions and is ERE-independent.",

Here we report our identification of an evolutionarily conserved AAA+ protein, ANCCA/pro2000, endowed with a bromodomain that is strongly induced by estrogen in human breast cancer cells and is a direct target of protooncogene ACTR/AIB1/SRC-3. We found that ANCCA associates directly with estrogen-bound estrogen receptor (ER) alpha and ACTR. It is selectively recruited, upon estrogen stimulation, to a subset of ERalpha target genes including cyclin D1, c-myc, and E2F1 and is required for their estrogen-induced expression as well as breast cancer cell proliferation. Further studies indicate that ANCCA binds and hydrolyzes ATP and is critical for recruitment of coregulator CBP and histone hyperacetylation at the ER target chromatin. Moreover, mutations at the ATP binding motifs rendered ANCCA defective as a coactivator in mediating estrogen induction of gene expression. Together, our findings reveal an unexpected layer of regulatory mechanism in hormone signaling mediated by ANCCA and suggest that hormone-induced assembly of transcriptional coregulator complexes at chromatin is a process facilitated by AAA+ ATPase proteins.",

        "abstracttext": "The transcriptional activity of the estrogen receptor (ER) is known to be highly modulated by the character and amount of coregulator proteins present in the cells. TR2 orphan receptor (TR2), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily without identified ligands, is found to be expressed in the breast cancer cell lines and to function as a repressor to suppress ER-mediated transcriptional activity. Utilizing an interaction blocker, ER-6 (amino acids 312-340), responsible for TR2 interaction, the suppression of ER by TR2 could be reversed, suggesting that this suppression is conferred by the direct protein-protein interaction. Administration of antisense TR2, resulting in an enhancement of ER transcriptional activity in MCF7 cells, indicates that endogenous TR2 normally suppresses ER-mediated signaling. To gain insights into the molecular mechanism by which TR2 suppresses ER, we found that TR2 could interrupt ER DNA binding via formation of an ER-TR2 heterodimer that disrupted the ER homodimerization. The suppression of ER transcription by TR2 consequently caused the inhibition of estrogen-induced cell growth and G(1)/S transition in estrogen-dependent breast cancer cells. Taken together in addition to the potential roles in spermatogenesis and neurogenesis, our data provide a novel biological function of TR2 that may exert an important repressor in regulating ER activity in mammary glands.",

Its cellular role is still unclear and a positive as well as an inhibitory role in mitogenesis depending on the cell context has been implicated. We have tested other mitogenic receptor tyrosine kinases as putative Grb10 partners and have identified the activated forms of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor beta (PDGFRbeta), hepatocyte growth factor receptor (Met), and fibroblast growth factor receptor as candidates. We have mapped Y771 as a PDFGRbeta site that is involved in the association with Grb10 via its SH2 domain. We have further investigated the putative role of Grb10 in mitogenesis with four independent experimental strategies and found that all consistently suggested a role as a positive, stimulatory signaling adaptor in normal fibroblasts. (i) Complete Grb10 expression from cDNA with an ecdysone-regulated transient expression system stimulated PDGF-BB-, IGF-I, and insulin- but not epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced DNA synthesis in an ecdysone dose-responsive fashion. (ii) Microinjection of the (dominant-negative) Grb10 SH2 domain interfered with PDGF-BB- and insulin-induced DNA synthesis. (iii) Alternative experiments were based on cell-permeable fusion peptides with the Drosophila antennapedia homeodomain which effectively traverse the plasma membrane of cultured cells. A cell-permeable Grb10 SH2 domain similarly interfered with PDGF-BB-, IGF-I-, and insulin-induced DNA synthesis. In contrast, a cell-permeable Grb10 Pro-rich putative SH3 domain binding region interfered with IGF-I- and insulin- but not with PDGF-BB- or EGF-induced DNA synthesis. (iv) Transient overexpression of complete Grb10 increased whereas cell-permeable Grb10 SH2 domain fusion peptides substantially decreased the cell proliferation rate (as measured by cell numbers) in normal fibroblasts. These experimental strategies independently suggest that Grb10 functions as a positive, stimulatory, mitogenic signaling adapter in PDGF-BB, IGF-I, and insulin action. This function appears to involve the Grb10 SH2 domain, a novel sequence termed BPS, and the Pro-rich putative SH3 domain binding region in IGF-I- and insulin-mediated mitogenesis. In contrast, PDGF-BB-mediated mitogenesis appears to depend on the SH2 but not on the Pro-rich region and may involve other, unidentified Grb10 domains. Distinct protein domains may help to define specific Grb10 functions in different signaling pathways.",

Glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays, mammalian two-hybrid assays, and immunoprecipitation studies showed that PP5 directly binds to both ERalpha and ERbeta via its tetratricopeptide repeat domain. E domains of ERalpha and ERbeta, without containing activation domain core regions in transcription activation function 2, were required for the binding to PP5. In ERalpha-positive breast cancer MCF7 cells, estrogen- and epidermal growth factor-dependent phosphorylation of ERalpha on serine residue 118, a major phosphorylation site of the receptor, was reduced by expressing PP5 but enhanced by PP5 antisense oligonucleotide. Estrogen-induced transcriptional activities of both ERalpha and ERbeta and mRNA expression of estrogen-responsive genes, including pS2, c-myc, and cyclin D1, were suppressed by PP5 but enhanced by PP5 antisense oligonucleotide. A truncated PP5 mutant consisting only of its tetratricopeptide repeat domain acted as a dominant negative PP5 that enhanced serine residue 118 phosphorylation of ERalpha and transactivations by ERalpha and ERbeta. We present the first evidence that PP5 functions as an inhibitory regulator of ER phosphorylation and transcriptional activation in vivo.",

Several features distinguish the structure of FGFR1K from that of the tyrosine kinase domain of the insulin receptor. Residues in the activation loop of FGFR1K appear to interfere with substrate peptide binding but not with ATP binding, revealing a second and perhaps more general autoinhibitory mechanism for receptor tyrosine kinases. In addition, a dimeric form of FGFR1K observed in the crystal structure may provide insights into the molecular mechanisms by which FGF receptors are activated. Finally, the structure provides a basis for rationalizing the effects of kinase mutations in FGF receptors that lead to developmental disorders in nematodes and humans.",

Recent studies have shown that Nek6 is upregulated in various human cancers, but the function of Nek6 in tumorigenesis is largely unknown. Here, we examined the role of Nek6 in cellular senescence. Our data revealed that Nek6 expression is decreased both in both the replicative senescence of human normal fibroblasts and premature senescence induced by p53 expression in EJ human bladder cancer cells and H1299 human lung cancer cells. Interestingly, the enforced expression of Nek6 in EJ and H1299 cells completely suppresses p53-induced senescence, whereas the expression of kinase-dead Nek6 did not affect p53-induced senescence. Mechanistic studies revealed that cell cycle arrest in the G1 and G2/M phases, as well as the reduction of cyclin B and cdc2 protein level upon p53 expression were significantly reduced by Nek6 overexpression. In addition, p53-induced increases in intracellular levels of ROS were also inhibited in cells overexpressing Nek6. These results suggest that the downregulation of Nek6 expression is required for the onset of p53-induced cellular senescence and imply a possible role of Nek6 in tumorigenesis.",

Under starvation conditions, ULK1,Atg14, WIPI-1, LC3 and Atg16L1 target to the same compartment, whereas DFCP1 localizes adjacently to these Atgproteins. In terms of puncta formation, the protein complex including ULK1 and FIP200 is the most upstream unit and is required for puncta formation of the Atg14-containing PI3-kinase complex. Puncta formation of both DFCP1 and WIPI-1 requires FIP200 and Atg14. The Atg12-Atg5-Atg16L1 complex and LC3 are downstream units among these factors. The punctate structures containing upstream Atg proteins such as ULK1 and Atg14 tightly associate with the ER, where the ER protein vacuole membrane protein 1 (VMP1) also transiently localizes. These structures are formed even when cells are treated with wortmannin to suppress autophagosome formation.

Accordingly, Northern blot analysis identifies an mRNA for alpha v, but not for beta 3 in carcinoma cells. This receptor appears to mediate cell adhesion to vitronectin as well as fibronectin since an antibody directed to its alpha subunit blocked carcinoma cell adhesion to both of these matrix proteins.

We show that in the absence of its ligand-binding domain, the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is able to interact with both nuclear receptor coactivators and the BRG1 chromatin-remodeling complex in vivo. Individually, the GR makes direct interactions with BRG1-associated factor 60a (BAF60a) and BAF57, but not with BRG1, BAF155, or BAF170. Further, BAF60a possesses at least two interaction surfaces, one for GR and BRG1 and a second for BAF155 and BAF170. A GR mutant, GR(R488Q), that fails to interact with BAF60a in vitro has reduced chromatin-remodeling activity and reduced transcriptional activity from the promoter assembled as chromatin in vivo. Stable expression of a BAF60a truncation mutant, BAF60a4-140, caused chromatin-specific loss of GR functions in vivo. In the presence of the BAF60a mutant, the GR fails to interact with the BRG1 complex and consequently is also deficient in its ability to activate transcription from chromatin. Thus, in addition to previously identified BAF250, BAF60a may provide another critical and direct link between nuclear receptors and the BRG1 complex that is required for promoter recruitment and subsequent chromatin remodeling.",

Based on previous structural analysis of the human LRP1 gene (Van Leuven et al., 1994, Genomics, 24: 78-89), a strategy was developed to sequence the 89 exons of the LRP1 gene, including partial intron sequences. The gene was amplified from individual genomic DNA by long-range PCR, in 14 amplicons sized between 0.4 and 11 kb that were used as templates for 110 sequencing primers. In total, 48 mutations and intronic polymorphisms were identified. Two previously reported polymorphisms, i.e., in the promoter region and in exon 3, were precisely defined by sequencing. The first expressed mutation, i.e., an alanine to valine transition at position 217 of the LRP precursor protein, was detected on one allele in 2 of 33 individuals. Although the strategy is still subject to refinement, this approach is reported to allow others to analyze genetic differences in the human LRP1 gene, with particular reference to the recently reported association with late-onset Alzheimer disease.",

Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that CCDC62/ERAP75 can be recruited by the estrogen response element-ER complex in the presence of ligand. Furthermore, a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated the hormone-dependent recruitment of CCDC62/ERAP75 within the promoter of the estrogen-responsive gene cyclin D1. In addition, using silencing RNA (siRNA) against endogeneous CCDC62/ERAP75, we demonstrated that inhibition of endogenous CCDC62/ERAP75 results in the suppression of ERbeta-mediated transactivation as well as target gene expression in LNCaP cells. More importantly, using the tet-on overexpression system, we showed that induced expression of CCDC62/ERAP75 can enhance the E2-regulated cyclin D1 expression and cell growth in LNCaP cells. Together, our results revealed the role of CCDC62/ERAP75 as a novel coactivator in PCa cells that can modulate ERbeta transactivation and receptor function.",

        "abstracttext": "Current non-gel techniques for analyzing proteomes rely heavily on mass spectrometric analysis of enzymatically digested protein mixtures. Prior to analysis, a highly complex peptide mixture is either separated on a multidimensional chromatographic system or it is first reduced in complexity by isolating sets of representative peptides. Recently, we developed a peptide isolation procedure based on diagonal electrophoresis and diagonal chromatography. We call it combined fractional diagonal chromatography (COFRADIC). In previous experiments, we used COFRADIC to identify more than 800 Escherichia coli proteins by tandem mass spectrometric (MS/MS) analysis of isolated methionine-containing peptides. Here, we describe a diagonal method to isolate N-terminal peptides. This reduces the complexity of the peptide sample, because each protein has one N terminus and is thus represented by only one peptide. In this new procedure, free amino groups in proteins are first blocked by acetylation and then digested with trypsin. After reverse-phase (RP) chromatographic fractionation of the generated peptide mixture, internal peptides are blocked using 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS); they display a strong hydrophobic shift and therefore segregate from the unaltered N-terminal peptides during a second identical separation step. N-terminal peptides can thereby be specifically collected for further liquid chromatography (LC)-MS/MS analysis. Omitting the acetylation step results in the isolation of non-lysine-containing N-terminal peptides from in vivo blocked proteins.",

FGF-independent activation of STAT1 was demonstrated at the Golgi apparatus where it was colocalized with FGFRs. Both FGFR1 and FGFR2 induced strong phosphorylation of STAT1 causing redistribution of the Golgi apparatus, while FGFR3 and FGFR4 induced less phosphorylation of STAT1 and little or no redistribution of the Golgi apparatus. Upon expression of a cytosolic mutant of FGFR4 lacking the transmembrane as well as the extracellular region (CytR4), STAT1 was phosphorylated and transferred to the nucleus. The results indicate that immature forms of FGFRs form incomplete signaling complexes on Golgi membranes trapping phospho-STAT1 on this organelle.",

Thus, the three-dimensional structure has now been solved for a human HSD member of the aldo-keto reductase superfamily. AKR1C2 is implicated in the prostatic production of the potent androgen 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone and the hepatic transport of bile acids. It also catalyzes the formation of the neurosteroid 3alpha-hydroxy-5alpha-pregnan-20-one in the central nervous system, and its allosteric modulation by fluoxetine has been linked to the use of this drug for premenstrual dsyphoria. Like other members of the superfamily, AKR1C2 folds into an alpha/beta-barrel and binds NADP(+) in an extended conformation. The carboxylate of ursodeoxycholate binds to AKR1C2 in the oxyanion hole at the active site. More interestingly, the orientation of ursodeoxycholate is essentially \"backwards\" and \"upside-down\" from that observed for testosterone in the related rat 3alpha-HSD.NADP(+).testosterone ternary complex, where testosterone assumes the position of a 3-ketosteroid substrate. The orientation of ursodeoxycholate is thus similar to that expected of a 17beta-HSD substrate. The ternary structure explains the ability of AKR1C2 to catalyze 3alpha-, 17beta-, and 20alpha-HSD reactions. Comparison of the steroid binding pocket of AKR1C2 with that of rat 3alpha-HSD reveals significant differences in the positions of conserved and nonconserved loop residues, providing insights into the structural basis for the functional flexibility that is observed in all the human 3alpha-HSD isoforms but not in the rat isoform.",

The enzyme's 17beta-HSD activity was studied in comparison with its 3alpha-HSD activity. The enzyme catalyzes the inactivation of dihydrotestosterone into 5alpha-androstane-3alpha,17beta-diol (3alpha-diol) as well as the transformation of androstenedione into testosterone. Using our homogeneous and highly active enzyme preparation, we have obtained 150-fold higher 3alpha-HSD specificity as compared with the former reports in the literature. Although the rat and the human 3alpha-HSDs share 81% sequence homology, our structure reveals significantly different geometries of the active sites. Substitution of the Ser(222) by a histidine in the human enzyme may compel the steroid to adopt a different binding to that previously described for the rat (Bennett, M. J., Albert, R. H., Jez, J. M., Ma, H., Penning, T. M., and Lewis, M. (1997) Structure 5, 799-T812).

In search of interacting proteins of MST2, we found that estrogen receptor \u03b1 (ER\u03b1) co-immunoprecipitates with MST2 and its adaptor protein human Salvador (hSAV). Using reporter assays, we observed that overexpression of MST2 and hSAV leads to ligand-independent activation of ER\u03b1 in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells, which was attenuated by the knockdown of hSAV. Furthermore, using truncated mutants of hSAV, we observed that the C terminus of hSAV is necessary and sufficient for the induction of ER\u03b1 transactivation. The expression of hSAV and MST2 results in the phosphorylation of ER\u03b1 at serine residues 118 and 167 and represses ER\u03b1 expression. We then investigated the incidence of MST2 and ER\u03b1 expression with other tumor biomarkers using commercially available tissue microarrays. Among 40 breast cancer samples analyzed, 60% (24 out of 40) expressed MST2. Nineteen among the 40 cases were MST2-positive and ER\u03b1-negative, implying a correlation between expressions of MST2 with loss of ER\u03b1 in breast tumor samples.

Recent evidence suggests that this large protease has more specific functions in a number of important cellular processes, ranging from activation of the transcription factor NFkB and antigen processing to transit through mitosis. We have identified a component of the 26S proteasome that interacts specifically with MB67, an orphan member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. MIP224 (MB67 interacting protein) was isolated using the yeast two hybrid system and is apparently identical to the human 26S proteasome component TBP7. MIP224/TBP7 is one of several proteasomal proteins that share a strongly conserved ATPase domain (CAD) which is also present in a rapidly expanding superfamily of proteins with diverse functions. In yeast, MIP224 interacts specifically with MB67 and another closely related orphan receptor, but does not interact with several other receptor superfamily members tested. In mammalian cells, coexpression of MIP224 inhibits transactivation by MB67. MIP224 also interacts in yeast with other CAD proteins, including MSS1, which is proteasomal, and TRIP1, which is associated with transcriptional activation. This interaction of a proteasomal protein with a transcriptional protein suggests a previously unexpected link between the processes of protein degradation and transcriptional regulation.",

The results shown herein indicate that two different Tat domains cooperate to induce these effects by different pathways.

We have previously shown that activation of the cyclin A-CDK2 complex by overexpression of cyclin A leads to enhanced ER-dependent transcriptional activation and that the cyclin A-CDK2 complex phosphorylates the ER N-terminal activation function-1 (AF-1) between residues 82 and 121. Within ER AF-1, serines 104, 106, and 118 represent potential CDK phosphorylation sites, and in this current study, we ascertain their importance in mediating cyclin A-CDK2-dependent enhancement of ER transcriptional activity. Cyclin A overexpression does not enhance transcriptional activation by an ER derivative bearing serine-to-alanine changes at residues 104, 106, and 118. Likewise, the cyclin A-CDK2 complex does not phosphorylate this triple-mutated derivative in vitro. Individual serine-to-alanine mutations at residues 104 and 106, but not 118, decrease ER-dependent transcriptional enhancement in response to cyclin A. The same relationship holds for ER phosphorylation by cyclin A-CDK2 in vitro. Finally, enhancement of ER transcriptional activation by cyclin A is evident in the absence and presence of estradiol, as well as in the presence of tamoxifen, suggesting that the effect of the cyclin A-CDK2 on ER transcriptional activation is AF-2-independent. These results indicate that the enhancement of ER transcriptional activation by the cyclin A-CDK2 complex is mediated via the AF-1 domain by phosphorylation of serines 104 and 106. We propose that these residues control ER AF-1 activity in response to signals that affect cyclin A-CDK2 function.",

In this way, the parallel use of Lys-N and trypsin enabled a 72% increase in the number of detected phosphopeptides as compared to trypsin alone, whereas a trypsin replicate experiment only led to a 25% increase. Thus, when focusing solely on the trypsin and Lys-N data, we identified 4671 nonredundant phosphopeptides.

During hemostasis, binding of adhesive substrates to tyrosine-kinase-linked adhesion receptors and/or soluble agonists to G-protein coupled receptors leads to a cascade of intracellular signaling processes based on substrate (de)phosphorylation. The same mechanisms are involved in platelet activation at sites of atherosclerotic plaque rupture, contributing to vessel occlusion and consequently to pathologic states, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, or peripheral artery disease. To gain a deeper insight into platelet function, we analyzed the phosphoproteome of resting platelets and identified 564 phosphorylation sites from more than 270 proteins, of which many have not been described in platelets before. Among those were several unknown potential protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase G (PKG) substrates. Because platelet inhibition is tightly regulated especially by PKA and PKG activity, these proteins may represent important new targets for cardiovascular research. Thus, our finding that GPIbalpha is phosphorylated at Ser603 in resting platelets may represent a novel mechanism for the regulation of one of the most important platelet receptor (GPIb-IX-V) mediated signaling pathways by PKA/PKG.",

The overall fold of CR7 is similar to those of CR3 and CR8 from the LRP and LB5 from the LDL receptor, though the low degree of sequence homology of residues not involved in calcium coordination or in disulfide formation results in a distinct pattern of surface residues for each domain, including CR7. The thermodynamic parameters for Ca(2+) binding at both extracellular and endosomal pHs were determined by isothermal titration calorimetry for CR7 and for related complement-like repeats CR3, CR8, and LB5. Although the drop in pH resulted in a reduction in calcium affinity in each case, the changes were very variable in magnitude, being as low as a 2-fold reduction for CR3. This suggests that a pH-dependent change in calcium affinity alone cannot be responsible for the release of bound protein ligands from the LRP at the pH prevailing in the endosome, which in turn requires one or more other pH-dependent effects for regulating protein ligand release.",

        "abstracttext": "A proband with arterial ruptures and skin changes characteristic of the type IV variant of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome was found to have a single-base mutation in the type III procollagen gene, which converted the codon for glycine at amino acid position 1018 to a codon for aspartate. (Amino acid positions are numbered by the standard convention in which the first glycine of the triple-helical domain of an alpha chain is number 1. The numbers of positions in the alpha 1(III) chains can be converted to positions in the human pro alpha(III) chain by adding 167.) Nucleotide sequencing of overlapping PCR products in which the two alleles were distinguished demonstrated that the mutation of glycine 1018 was the only mutation that changed the primary structure of type III procollagen. The glycine substitution markedly decreased the amount of type III procollagen secreted into the medium by cultured skin fibroblasts from the proband. It is surprising that the same mutation was found in about 94% of the peripheral blood leukocytes from the proband's asymptomatic 72-year-old mother. Other tissues from the mother contained the mutated allele; it was present in 0%-100% of different samples of hair cells and in about 40% of cells from the oral epithelium. Therefore, the mother was a mosaic for the mutation. Since the mutated allele was present in cells derived from all three germ layers, the results indicated that the mutation arose by the late blastocyst stage of development. The results also indicate that assays of blood leukocytes do not always reveal mosaicism or predict phenotypic involvement of tissues, such as blood vessels, that are derived from the same embryonic cells as are leukocytes.",

        "abstracttext": "Evidence is emerging that estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) is central to the rapid transduction of estrogen signaling to the downstream kinase cascades; however, the mechanisms underlying this nongenomic function are not fully understood. Here we report a paradigm of ERalpha regulation through arginine methylation by PRMT1, which transiently methylates arginine 260 within the ERalpha DNA-binding domain. This methylation event is required for mediating the extranuclear function of the receptor by triggering its interaction with the p85 subunit of PI3K and Src. Furthermore, we find that the focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a Src substrate involved in the migration process, is also recruited in this complex. Our data indicate that the methylation of ERalpha is a physiological process occurring in the cytoplasm of normal and malignant epithelial breast cells and that ERalpha is hypermethylated in a subset of breast cancers.",

        "abstracttext": "Mutations in KAL1 and FGFR1 cause Kallmann syndrome (KS), whereas mutations in the GNRHR and GPR54 genes cause idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism with normal olfaction (nIHH). Mixed pedigrees containing both KS and nIHH have also been described; however, the genetic cause of these rare cases is unknown. We examined the FGFR1 gene in seven nIHH subjects who either belonged to a mixed pedigree (n = 5) or who had associated midline defects (n = 2). Heterozygous FGFR1 mutations were found in three of seven unrelated nIHH probands with normal MRI of the olfactory system: (i) G237S in an nIHH female and a KS brother; (ii) (P722H and N724K) in an nIHH male missing two teeth and his mother with isolated hyposmia; and (iii) Q680X in a nIHH male with cleft lip/palate and missing teeth, his brother with nIHH, and his father with delayed puberty. We show that these mutations lead to receptor loss-of-function. The Q680X leads to an inactive FGFR1, which lacks a major portion of the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD). The G237S mutation inhibits proper folding of D2 of the FGFR1 and likely leads to the loss of cell-surface expression of FGFR1. In contrast, the (P722H and N724K) double mutation causes structural perturbations in TKD, reducing the catalytic activity of TKD. We conclude that loss-of-function mutations in FGFR1 cause nIHH with normal MRI of the olfactory system. These mutations also account for some of the mixed pedigrees, thus challenging the current idea that KS and nIHH are distinct entities.",

Highly conserved FGF-D2 and FGF-linker (between D2-D3) interfaces define a general binding site for all FGF-FGFR complexes. Specificity is achieved through interactions between the N-terminal and central regions of FGFs and two loop regions in D3 that are subject to alternative splicing. These structures provide a molecular basis for FGF1 as a universal FGFR ligand and for modulation of FGF-FGFR specificity through primary sequence variations and alternative splicing.",

        "abstracttext": "The ubiquitin fusion-degradation gene (UFD1L) encodes the human homologue of the yeast ubiquitin fusion-degradation 1 protein, an essential component of the ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic turnover and mRNA processing. Although the UFD1L gene has been mapped in the region commonly deleted in patients with DiGeorge syndrome (DGS)/velocardiofacial syndrome (VCFS), correlation between its haploinsufficiency and the phenotype has not yet been established. The only functional data available about mammalian Ufd1p is the ability to form a complex with the rat Npl4 protein, a component of the nuclear pore complex. In this paper we report the cloning and molecular characterization of the human NPL4 gene. This gene encodes for a protein 96% homologous to the rat Npl4, and 44 and 34% homologous to the C. elegans and S. cerevisiae Npl4 gene products, respectively. Fluorescence in situ hybridization experiments on human metaphases localized the NPL4 gene on the most telomeric region of chromosome 17q. Northern blots analysis on foetal and adult human tissues revealed a major approximately 4.5 kb transcript most abundant in heart, brain, kidney and skeletal muscle. In order to test a potential relationship between nuclear transport defects and some aspect of the DGS/VCFS phenotype, we also exclude the presence of mutations in the NPL4 coding sequence in a subset of patients with DGS/VCFS and no detectable 22q11 deletion or mutations at the UFD1L locus.",

The two additional tripeptide units, together with three previously detected, establish that the alpha 1 (III) chain is 15 amino acids longer than either the alpha 1 (I) or alpha 2 (I) chains of type I collagen. The additional tripeptide units made hydropathy plots of the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of type III collagen distinctly different from those of type I collagen. The data also demonstrated that human type III procollagen has the same third base preference in codons for glycine, proline and alanine that was previously found with human and chick type I procollagen. In addition, comparison of two cDNA clones from the same individual revealed a variation in structure in that the codon for amino acid 880 of the alpha 1 (III) chain was -CTT- for leucine in one clone and -TTT- for phenylalanine in the other.",

        "abstracttext": "We have approached the problem of MHC class II ligand motifs by pool sequencing natural peptides eluted from HLA-DR, DQ, and DP molecules. The results indicate surprisingly clear patterns, although not quite as clear as with natural class I ligands. The most striking feature is a highly dominant Proline at position 2. We interpret this to be a consequence of aminopeptidase N-like activity in processing. Another general aspect is the existence of three to four hydrophobic or aromatic anchors, whereby the first and the last are separated by five to eight residues. The peptide motifs for HLA-DR1, DR5, DQ7, and DPw4 are allele-specific and differ by spacing and occupancy of anchors. The anchors tend to be flanked by clusters of charged residues, and small residues, especially Ala, are frequent in the motif centers. These detailed motifs allow one to interpret most previous (DR-) motifs as fitting one or more of the anchors or conserved clusters. The relative motif symmetry suggests the possibility of bidirectional binding of peptides in the class II groove.",

        "abstracttext": "Alterations in the amino acid sequence of the estrogen receptor (ER) have been shown to have dramatic effects on its function. Recently, mutant ERs have been isolated from both clinical samples and established breast cancer cell lines, primarily through the use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). All previously reported mutations have given rise to either alterations or truncations of the ER protein. We determined the structure of a novel 80 kDa ER which is expressed in an estrogen independent subclone of the MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line (MCF-7:2A). This 80 kDa ER was initially detected by Western blot analysis using a variety of ER specific antibodies. PCR mapping and partial PCR mediated subcloning of the ER cDNA were used to demonstrate that this protein was an ER containing an in-frame duplication of exons 6 and 7. This type of duplication has not been previously described for any members of the steroid receptor superfamily. Karyotype analysis coupled with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) demonstrated that MCF-7:2A cells contained 4-5 copies of the ER gene in contrast to 2 copies in MCF-7:WS8 cells. The ER gene was localized by FISH analyses in both the MCF-7:WS8 and MCF-7:2A cells on chromosome 6, which is the source of the ER in normal human cells. The relative expression level of 2:1 is consistent with DNA gene dosage analysis. Genomic PCR was then used to demonstrate that the 80 kDa ER mRNA was not derived from the trans-splicing of two ER mRNAs but was the result of a genomic rearrangement in which exons 6 and 7 were duplicated in an in-frame fashion. This variant ER may prove to be useful in elucidating the mechanism of estrogen action in breast cancer cells.",
